Of the fifty states in the United States, forty-nine are located on the mainland of North
America. The other state is Hawaii, which consists of several islands in the middle of the
Pacific Ocean. Hawaii is known as an especially beautiful and interesting place.
The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic eruptions that pushed molten rock, called
"lava," above the surface of the ocean. Some of the islands no longer have any volcanic
activity, but there are still active volcanoes on two Hawaiian islands, Oahu and the "big
island" (which is known simply as Hawaii). One of these volcanoes, Mauna Loa, still
erupts sometimes, with spectacular explosions of lava. Another volcano, called Mauna
Kea, is now dormant. These volcanoes are both very tall and reach over 4000 metres
above sea level. The air above Mauna Kea is so clear and thin that scientists use the
mountain as a base for observing the stars.
The islands of Hawaii are located in the tropics, and they are known for their beautiful
weather. The temperatures are usually in the range of 20 to 30 degrees Celsius, and the
days are usually sunny. This weather allows people to enjoy swimming and surfing on
the beautiful beaches of Hawaii. Despite the sunshine, most of the islands also receive
enough rainfall to support many beautiful flowers and trees.
The first people to live in Hawaii were Polynesian groups who arrived from other islands
in the Pacific, well over 1000 years ago. The islands were visited by European explorers
during the late eighteenth century. During the early nineteenth century, the islands
became unified under a single king. However, during this time, many Hawaiians died
from diseases that were brought by European and American visitors.
The Hawaiian islands are excellent places for growing sugar cane and pineapples. In the
late eighteenth century, some Americans began large farms, called "plantations," in
Hawaii. The Americans eventually gained control of the government, and Hawaii became
a territory of the United States. The United States built a naval base on the island of Oahu,
at Pearl Harbor. This base was attacked by Japan in 1941, but it was soon repaired. The
naval base is still in use today.
During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there was great demand for labour on the
sugar and pineapple plantations. People came to Hawaii from many lands, and Hawaii
became a place of many cultures. The native Hawaiians mixed with people from places
such as Japan, China, Korea, the Philippines, Portugal, and Puerto Rico, as well as the
mainland United States. Today, many Hawaiians can claim a diverse heritage.
In 1959, Hawaii became the 50th state of the United States, with the city of Honolulu as its
capital. Today, there are more than one million people in Hawaii, more than half of whom
live in Honolulu. Each year, many more people visit Hawaii as tourists, to experience the
beauty of these islands.

Article #23
Charles Darwin
Charles Darwin made what might be the most important scientific discovery of all time-
the theory of evolution by natural selection. It was Darwin who first understood how it
was that plants and animals evolved over time to produce new and different species. At
first, this theory faced much opposition, but since that time it has been supported by
evidence from many areas of science.
Darwin was born in a small town in England in 1809. When he was a young man, he went
to university, first to study medicine, and later to study religion. However, Darwin found
his schoolwork to be very boring. Instead, he preferred outdoor activities and was very
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
22 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
interested in nature.
While Darwin was at university, the British navy was planning to send one of its ships,
called the Beagle, on a voyage of exploration. As part of this voyage, the ship would need
a naturalist, who could study the various plants and animals that might be found. Darwin
was recommended for this job by one of his professors, who had been impressed by
Darwin.
Darwin was chosen as the naturalist of the Beagle, and the ship left England in 1831. The
ship's voyage took Darwin around the world, and he observed many species of plants
and animals on his trip. In one place near South America, known as the Galapagos
Islands, Darwin observed many unusual species of birds. Several of these birds seemed
closely related to each other, but they differed in interesting ways. For example, some
birds had long beaks that could reach insects hidden in the bark of trees, but other birds
had thick beaks that could break open the shells of nuts.
What Darwin realized was that certain characteristics could help an animal (or a plant) to
survive and reproduce. Individuals that lacked those characteristics would be more likely
to die without reproducing. Over many generations, the useful characteristics would then
become more and more common, as the surviving individuals passed the characteristics
on to their offspring. Eventually, after many generations, the changes would be so great
that a new species would exist. In this way, a single species could divide into two or
more new ones. This was called the "process of evolution by natural selection."
When Darwin returned to England, he studied plants and animals in more detail. After
much research, he began writing a book about his theory of evolution by natural
selection. When the book, The Origin of Species, was published in 1859, it was very
popular and very controversial.
During the next twenty years, Darwin continued his scientific research, and he wrote
several more books. By the time of his death, in 1882, many biologists had realized that
Darwin had made one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time. For the first
time, scientists could understand the origin of the many different species of plants and
animals.

Article #24
Jazz
One of the most popular forms of music is known as jazz. Each year, hundreds of
thousands of people attend jazz concerts and festivals in cities around the world. Jazz
music, both old and new, is played on the radio and on home stereos.
Two of the most important features of jazz music are "improvisation" and "syncopation."
Improvisation means that music is created spontaneously by the musician during a
performance. In other words, the musician modifies some existing music in a new and
interesting way. Syncopation means that the regular patterns found in music may be
broken up, with new accents and uneven patterns being created. The features of
improvisation and syncopation are difficult to use with skill, and require great creativity
on the part of the musician.
Jazz music originated in the southern United States, during the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. It was based on African-American music that was derived in part
from rhythms in western Africa. The earliest jazz musicians were influenced by a music
style known as "ragtime," which was popular during the late nineteenth century. Jazz
music also incorporated some aspects of a related kind of music called the "blues."
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
23 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
By the beginning of the twentieth century, a fully developed form of jazz was being
played in New Orleans, a city in the southern United States. Jazz musicians played
instruments such as the trumpet, saxophone, cornet, and piano. Jazz soon became
popular and was played on the riverboats that travelled along the Mississippi River.
Some jazz musicians moved north to the city of Chicago, and young musicians in that
city developed some new forms of jazz music.
By the 1920s and 1930s, jazz was popular in many parts of the United States, and some
musicians began forming large bands, comprising many musicians and many different
instruments. This began the period known as the "big band" era when a popular form of
jazz known as "swing" music was played. During the 1940s and 1950s, other forms of
jazz, known as "bop" and "cool" jazz, were developed. Some people preferred these
newer kinds of jazz, but others preferred the older varieties.
By the 1960s, some jazz musicians began to experiment with different kinds of musical
instruments and with other kinds of music. Some musicians incorporated musical styles
from other parts of the world, or combined jazz with rock music, and today some
musicians have blended jazz with rap music. However, some people prefer the more
traditional forms of jazz music.
Of course, most of the great jazz musicians of the early twentieth century-people such as
Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, and Billie Holliday-are no
longer alive. However, many great jazz musicians are still active, and many younger
musicians have continued this form of music. People will continue to enjoy jazz music
for a long time to come.

Article #25
Australia : Nature
Australia is the only country in the world that is also a continent. Located in the southern
hemisphere, between the Pacific and Indian oceans, Australia is one of the largest
countries in the world.
Despite its vast size, Australia does not have a large population. In the year 2000, there
were about 19 million people in Australia. Most Australians live within a short distance of
the ocean, because much of the interior of Australia is extremely dry. The remote areas of
Australia, known as the "outback," contain several sandy, rocky deserts. Some parts of
the outback receive somewhat more rainfall, and can support some grassy vegetation. In
these areas, there are many ranches, or farms, where sheep and cattle are raised.
Although the outback of Australia is a harsh place, some parts of it are quite beautiful. In
the middle of the Australian continent, a large red rock known as Uluru stands in the
desert. It is nearly 350 metres tall and is nearly 10 kilometres around. Tourists come from
all over the world to see this huge and beautiful rock in the middle of a flat desert.
In contrast to the dry interior areas, the northern coast of Australia receives a great deal
of rainfall. This area is covered in thick, lush vegetation, with tropical rainforests whose
exotic trees and flowers are found nowhere else in the world. Off the north-east coast of
the continent, a large coral reef known as the Great Barrier Reef is found. A coral reef is a
structure that consists of the bodies of small underwater animals called coral, whose
dead bodies create this unusual structure beneath the surface of the water. The reef and
the underwater life surrounding it are especially beautiful.
Australia was separated from the rest of the world for millions of years. As a result, many
of the plant and animal species in Australia are very different from those in other parts of
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
24 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
the world. For example, many of the animals in Australia belong to a special category
called the "marsupials." Marsupials are mammals, but they are a special kind of mammal,
because they give birth to offspring that are not yet well developed. In many marsupials,
the offspring continue to develop, after being born, inside a pocket or "pouch" on the
mother's body.
The most famous marsupial is the kangaroo. Kangaroos can travel at great speeds by
hopping on their hind legs and using their large tails for balance. The kangaroo is a
rather large animal, with the larger individuals sometimes weighing 90 kilograms.
Another famous marsupial is the koala. This animal is sometimes called a koala bear
because it looks somewhat like a small bear. The koala lives in the branches of trees
called eucalyptus trees. Koalas eat the leaves of eucalyptus trees.
Of course, Australia also has people. We will discuss the people of Australia in the next
passage.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #26
Australia : People
The first people who lived in Australia were known as the Aborigines. The Aborigines
came to Australia by boat more than 40,000 years ago. They are the first people in the
world who are known to have used boats for transportation.
Even though many parts of Australia were very inhospitable places, the Aborigines
survived. They lived by hunting and gathering throughout the continent, even in the
desert areas where survival is almost impossible. The Aborigines felt a deep spiritual
attachment to the land, and they made many beautiful paintings upon the rocks of many
parts of the country. Their most famous invention is a curved hunting stick known as the
"boomerang." The design of the boomerang is remarkable, because it can be thrown in
such a way that it will turn around and return to the person who threw it.
Until about two hundred years ago, the Aborigines had only a very limited amount of
contact with people in the outside world. The next people to migrate to Australia were
from the British Isles. Beginning in the late eighteenth century, Australia was used as a
prison colony, where common criminals and political prisoners were sent from Britain.
By the middle of the nineteenth century, many British people moved to Australia
voluntarily to begin farms or to search for gold. By the late nineteenth century, Britain
stopped sending its prisoners to Australia, but migration continued.
After the arrival of the British colonists, the Aboriginal population declined sharply. This
was partly due to disease, partly due to cruel treatment by settlers, and partly due to the
loss of their traditional way of life. Today, the Aboriginal population is growing again, and
the Australian government has taken some steps to correct the injustices of the past.
The various parts of Australia were governed at first as separate colonies, but in 1901
they joined to form a single country. Australia continued to grow during the twentieth
century, and after World War Two it attracted many immigrants from countries in Europe.
During the past few decades, many people have moved to Australia from various parts of
Asia and from other parts of the world.
Today, Australia consists of one territory (the Northern Territory) and six states (Western
Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland).
Tasmania is a small island off the southern coast, and Victoria, New South Wales, and
Queensland are found in the eastern part of the country.
The two largest cities in Australia are Sydney and Melbourne, both of which are in the
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
25 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
southeastern part of the country. Sydney has a beautiful harbor that is one of the largest
in the world, and Melbourne has many beautiful parks and gardens. The capital city of the
country is Canberra, which is located between Sydney and Melbourne. Other large cities
in Australia are Brisbane (in the northeast), Perth (in the southwest), and Adelaide (in the
south).

Article #27
The Earth Revolves Around the Sun
One year is the time required for the earth to travel around the sun. For most of history,
however, people did not know that the earth moved around the sun. Instead, people
believed that the sun moved around the earth.
The old idea that the sun moved around the earth is known as the "geocentric" theory.
This idea was first made famous by an ancient Greek scientist, Ptolemy, who lived in
Egypt nearly 2000 years ago. Some other Greek philosophers had suggested instead that
the earth might travel around the sun. However, this idea, which is known as the
"heliocentric" theory, was not widely accepted. For centuries, people in Europe did not
seriously question Ptolemy's geocentric theory.
During the early fifteenth century, however, a Polish astronomer named Nicolaus
Copernicus began to think that the heliocentric idea was right, and that the geocentric
idea was wrong. Shortly before his death, Copernicus wrote a book that described the
mathematical details of his theory that the earth revolved, or travelled, around the sun.
Later astronomers came to agree with Copernicus's view. One of the most famous of
these was Galileo, an Italian scientist. Galileo was famous for demonstrating that light
and heavy objects fall at exactly the same speed, unless an object is so light that it is
slowed by the air. Galileo was also the first astronomer to use a powerful telescope to
observe the sky. He discovered many unknown features of the moon, the sun, and the
planets.
When Galileo announced that he believed in Copernicus's theory that the earth revolved
around the sun, some officials of the Roman Catholic Church were angry. They argued
that this theory was against the beliefs of the Church. Some church officials disagreed
with this view, but the authorities decided that Galileo should be punished by "house
arrest." (In other words, Galileo was not allowed to leave his house.) Also, Galileo was
forced to make a public statement that renounced his belief in the heliocentric theory.
At about the same time that Galileo supported the heliocentric idea, another astronomer
did some important work that supported Copernicus's view. This astronomer was
Johannes Kepler, who lived in Germany. Kepler used the observations of previous
scientists to figure out the motion of the planets around the sun. He realized that the
planets did not travel in circular paths, but instead in paths that were elliptical, or oval, in
shape. Kepler's discoveries showed mathematically how the planets would revolve
around the sun.
Today, everyone knows that the earth moves around the sun; but for a long time, it
seemed more reasonable to believe that the sun moved around the earth. We can thank
the great scientists of the past who discovered the surprising truth.

Article #28
George Washington Carver
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
26 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
George Washington Carver is possibly the most famous agricultural scientist of all time.
He invented hundreds of products that could be made from crops such as peanuts and
sweet potatoes, and he changed the methods of farming in the southern United States.
The story of George Washington Carver's life is interesting and inspiring, as it shows
how some people can achieve success despite adversity.
George Washington Carver was born in a small town in the American state of Missouri, in
1864 or 1865. He was named after the first President of the United States. George's
parents were slaves. His father was killed in an accident, and his mother was kidnapped
and later died. George and his brother were raised by a married couple, the Carvers, who
had owned George's mother.
George was often sick during his childhood, but he showed an intense interest in nature.
The Carvers taught George to read and write, and he became known locally as an expert
on plants. Later, the Carvers sent George to a school for African-American children in a
nearby town. After his graduation, George Washington Carver continued his education in
the state of Iowa.
While a student in Iowa, Carver had very little money and had to work at many jobs to
afford the costs of his education. However, his knowledge of plants was very impressive,
and after receiving his Master's degree, he became a teacher at the college he had
attended as a student.
Soon, however, Carver moved south to the state of Alabama, where he worked as a
teacher and researcher at a college for African-American students. It was here that
Carver stayed for the rest of his life, and it was here that he performed his important
agricultural research.
One problem for farmers in the southern United States was that the most widespread
crops, cotton and tobacco, tended to remove nutrients from the soil. Carver realized that
this problem could be solved, to some extent, by "rotating" the cotton and tobacco crops
with other kinds of crops, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, which could help to
preserve the nutrients in the soil.
Carver's discoveries made the peanut, the sweet potato, and the soybean very useful to
southern farmers. He invented the food product known as peanut butter, plus hundreds
of other products. For example, Carver found ways to produce plastics, ink, cooking oil,
paints, and cosmetics from peanuts and other crops. Carver also developed a new
variety of cotton.
Carver received many awards for his scientific research, but he was never interested in
fame or fortune. When Carver died, in 1943, the American government made his
birthplace a national monument. Today, Carver is still known as a great agricultural
scientist.

Article #29
The Rights of the Accused
In English-speaking countries, the rights of an accused person are taken very seriously.
Over many centuries, laws evolved in such a way that people could not be arrested or
charged without a very good reason.
Of course, every country needs to enforce its laws. This means that police officers are
needed, and so are "prosecutors"-the lawyers whose job is to make criminal charges
against people who break the laws, and to prove that those charges are true. However, it
is very important that people's freedoms are not taken away wrongly. People should not
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
27 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
be punished unfairly, and people who are accused of crimes must have the opportunity
to defend themselves.
In some parts of the world, people can be arrested and imprisoned for long periods of
time, without any criminal charges being made against them. One of the most important
principles of justice in English-speaking countries is that a person cannot be held by the
police unless that person is charged with a crime. This principle is known by the Latin
term, "habeas corpus." According to the idea of habeas corpus, the police are not
allowed to detain a person for more than a certain period of time (usually, twenty-four
hours), unless some charge is made against the person. A judge will order the release of
a person who is not charged with a crime.
Another important feature of justice systems in most English-speaking countries is that
accused individuals have the right to be represented by a lawyer. Most accused people
want to hire an expert lawyer. However, even if a person cannot afford to hire a lawyer,
the criminal court must provide a lawyer who will represent that person. The lawyer for
an accused person is required to defend that person as thoroughly as possible.
One of the most important aspects of justice systems in the United States and the British
Commonwealth is that an accused person must be fully informed of any charges made
against them. Also, any evidence that will be used to show the accused person's guilt
must be shared with the accused person and with that person's lawyer. In this way,
accused persons can challenge the truth of any evidence that will be used against them.
Similarly, any person who acts as a witness against an accused person can be cross-
examined by the accused person's lawyer. This means that the statements of a witness
can be challenged by the accused person.
Another important element of most English-speaking justice systems is that evidence
must be obtained fairly. Police officers cannot simply enter a person's home to look for
evidence of a crime. They must first have a good reason to believe that a crime has been
committed, and they must obtain permission from a judge to enter the person's property.
This permission is called a "search warrant." Because search warrants are required,
people are free from arbitrary invasions of their property by the police.
Finally, another important aspect of most English-speaking justice systems is that trials
must be held in public, where other citizens can watch the trial. An accused person is not
tried secretly. Moreover, as discussed in another passage, the accused person has the
right to be tried by a jury of other free citizens. All of these rules ensure that order can be
maintained without taking away the freedom of innocent people.

Article #30
New York City
New York City is the largest city in the United States, and one of the largest cities in the
world. The city of New York has a population of over seven million people, and the
surrounding urban areas bring the total to about twenty million people. However, New
York City is not merely a very large city; it is also known as one of the world's leading
centers of financial, artistic, and media activities.
Compared with most of the great cities of the world, New York is very young. The first
permanent settlements were established during the seventeenth century, by settlers from
the Netherlands. Those people named their town "New Amsterdam." Soon, the colony
was taken over by English settlers, who re-named the city "New York." New York grew
quickly, and by the nineteenth century it was the largest city of the United States.
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
28 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
New York was usually the place where new immigrants to the United States would arrive.
In the nineteenth century, immigrants from Germany and Ireland were numerous in New
York. In the early twentieth century, New York City was the home of many Jewish
immigrants, and also immigrants from Italy. In addition, many African-American people
arrived in New York from other parts of the United States, and many persons came to
New York from the American territory of Puerto Rico, a Spanish-speaking island in the
Caribbean. In more recent decades, immigrants have arrived in New York from places all
over the world.
One of the most famous features of New York City is its dramatic skyline. New York has
more tall buildings, called "skyscrapers," than any other city in the world. Many of the
tallest and most interesting buildings in New York-including the Woolworth Building, the
Chrysler Building, and the Empire State Building-were constructed during the early
decades of the twentieth century. In addition to these impressive buildings, New York is
also known for the huge bridges that join the island of Manhattan to the surrounding
areas. The Brooklyn Bridge is the most famous of these remarkable and old bridges.
Of course, New York is famous for much more than just its architecture. New York City's
financial district, Wall Street, and its theatre district, centered on Broadway, are the most
important in the United States. Central Park is one of the world's great urban parks, and
the art galleries, museums, and concert halls are among the greatest to be found
anywhere. The United Nations has its headquarters in New York City. People around the
world recognize the famous Statue of Liberty, which stands on an island in the harbor of
New York, and the bustling Times Square, located in the mid-town Manhattan area.
Visitors to New York find it to be an extremely busy, fast-placed city and are struck by the
extremes of wealth and poverty that surround it. Many people love New York City, but
even those who would not want to live in New York do agree that it is a very interesting
place.

California
By far the most populous state of the United States is California. Located in the
southwestern corner of the United States, California is home to a great diversity of
natural environments and cultural influences. In the year 2000, over 33 million people
lived in California.
California's many mountains and valleys produce a wide variety of climates and natural
regions. In the interior, southeastern parts of the state are many areas of desert. For
example, Death Valley, which is so deep that it is below sea level, is extremely dry.
Temperatures in Death Valley sometimes exceed 50 degrees Celsius. Other valleys are
more pleasant and hospitable places. In the central valley, many farms grow vast
amounts of fruits and vegetables.
California also contains many tall, snow-covered mountains. On the slopes of some
mountains are forests that have very large trees. Some of the giant redwood trees of
California reach heights of 100 metres or more.
Many of the cities in California have Spanish names. This is because many of those cities
began as religious missions that were started by Spanish priests. Mexico owned
California during the early nineteenth century, but few Mexican people lived there. The
United States gained control of California during the 1840s, and the discovery of gold
brought many Americans and others to California.
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
29 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
Today, California contains some of the largest cities in the United States. Within the
greater Los Angeles area, one can find Hollywood, known as the movie capital of the
world. Many rich people live in suburbs such as Beverly Hills, and many poor people live
in other neighborhoods throughout the city. The Los Angeles area is home to over 15
million people, many of whom have immigrated to the United States from Mexico and
from many Asian countries. Los Angeles is a very large city that has spread across a
great area. As a consequence, the city has many traffic jams and air pollution, or smog,
is sometimes a problem.
Further north is the city of San Francisco, one of the most beautiful cities of the United
States. The image of the Golden Gate Bridge, which crosses the harbour of San
Francisco, is famous around the world. Also famous are the hilly streets of San
Francisco and the trolley cars that provide transportation along them. San Francisco's
Chinese community is one of the largest in North America, and the city also contains a
vibrant artistic and cultural life. San Francisco was destroyed by an earthquake in 1906
and was damaged again in 1989.
California has always had a special place in the imagination of Americans. This is hardly
surprising, given the variety and diversity of this vast state!

Article #32
Drug Use Among Athletes
Drug use is a common problem in many sports competitions today. In both professional
and amateur sports, many athletes use drugs that are designed to improve athletic
performance. The use of these drugs may have harmful effects on the future health of
athletes, but they also give an unfair advantage in athletic competitions.
Some of the most widely-used performance-enhancing drugs are called "anabolic
steroids." Anabolic steroids are drugs that are very similar to the male hormone,
testosterone. These drugs allow athletes to develop larger and stronger muscles, and to
increase the intensity of training. For sports that require strength, power, or speed, the
use of steroids can provide advantages. In past years, many famous sprinters and
weightlifters have been found to have used steroids.
However, anabolic steroids have many negative side effects. To give just a few examples,
steroids can cause changes in mood, including irritability and anger, and can also cause
skin problems such as acne. In men, steroid use can lead to reduction in the functioning
of the testicles. In women, steroid use can interfere with menstruation. In both men and
women, long-term side effects include an increased risk of some forms of cancer.
Another widely-used drug is known as EPO. EPO is a hormone that helps to produce red
blood cells, which carry oxygen to the muscles. When taken by athletes who compete in
sports that require great endurance, EPO may provide an advantage by allowing the
athletes to maintain their speed for a longer time and distance. During 1998, there was a
scandal at a famous bicycle race, the Tour de France, when it was found that many of
these long-distance cyclists were using EPO to gain an advantage over their competitors.
EPO has side effects. For example, it increases the likelihood of developing blood clots,
which increase the risk of a stroke or heart attack.
One difficulty in preventing the use of performance-enhancing drugs is that it is not
always possible to detect the use of the drugs. Tests have been developed to detect the
drugs, but new varieties of the drugs are often not detected. Also, athletes who stop
using the drugs well before a drug test may avoid being detected.
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

Preventing the use of performance-enhancing drugs in athletes is difficult, but it is
important. Most athletes want to compete without using artificial substances that provide
easy advantages, and they do not want to risk their health by using these substances. If
those athletes are to have a fair chance, it is necessary to prevent other athletes from
gaining advantages due to the use of these drugs.

Article #33
Scotland
Scotland is the country that is located on the northern part of the island of Great Britain.
The Scottish people are one of the four main nationalities of the British Isles, together
with the English, the Welsh, and the Irish. Scotland and its people have played an
important part in the history of the English-speaking world.
Scotland can be roughly divided into two main regions. The lowland areas, in the
southern part of Scotland, contain most of the population and the two main cities,
Edinburgh and Glasgow. Most of Scotland's agriculture and industry are located in the
lowland areas. The Highland areas, together with the islands that lie off the coast of
Scotland, are not so heavily populated. The lakes and mountains of the highlands are
known for their beautiful scenery.
One of the main themes of Scottish history is conflict with England. During the Middle
Ages, the English and Scottish kings were often at war. Around the year 1300, the Scots
repelled some invasions from England. During the 1600s, though, Scotland and England
had the same king, and the countries were officially joined as "the United Kingdom" in
1701.
For people in the highlands of Scotland, the eighteenth century was very difficult. Most
people worked as farmers on land that was owned by a few wealthy landlords. The
landlords decided that they could make more money on the land if they evicted the
farmers, so many of the farmers were forced to leave. The highlanders rebelled against
the King in 1745, but they were defeated. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
many people left the highlands of Scotland. They moved to the United States, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand. During the nineteenth century, Scotland was the first
country to have universal public education for children. The country produced a great
number of famous scientists and inventors during that time.
Scotland is famous for its national costume. This costume includes the "kilt," which is a
knee-length skirt worn by both men and women. The kilt is made from a fabric that
contains stripes of different colors and widths, which cross over each other to produce a
pattern that is called a "tartan." In the Scottish highlands, groups of related families,
called "clans," have their own unique tartan.
Another famous part of Scottish heritage is the musical instrument known as the
bagpipes. The bagpipes have a distinctive sound that is easily recognized. Bagpipes
were originally played to intimidate enemies in battle, but today Scottish people play the
bagpipes at parades and other celebrations. People of Scottish heritage around the world
celebrate their heritage on January 25th of each year. This day celebrates the birthday of
Robbie Burns, the famous Scottish poet. People celebrate this day at parties, where
people eat a famous Scottish food called haggis.
Today, Scotland remains part of the United Kingdom, but some Scottish people would
like Scotland to become independent. Whatever the Scottish people decide, their country
will remain a unique and interesting place.

London
The city of London is one of the most famous cities in the world. In previous centuries,
London was the centre of the British Empire. Today, it is one of the most important cities
of the emerging European Union.
London is located in southeastern England, on the Thames River (pronounced "tems").
The greater London area contains about 12 million people, and the surrounding areas
contain several million more. London was the first city in the modern world to have
reached a population of one million people.
London is a very old city, and many of its neighbourhoods maintain their distinct
character. One of the most famous parts of London is the East End, where people speak
with an accent known as "Cockney." One of the features of the Cockney accent is that
the letter "h" is often not pronounced.
London's population is very cosmopolitan. The city contains, in addition to people of
English background, large communities of South Asian, Chinese, African, and Caribbean
people. Most of these people have their origins in countries that belong to the British
Commonwealth of Nations.
Many of the most famous buildings in London are located in a small central area. This
area contains several huge churches, including Westminster Abbey, where many famous
people are buried. Another famous church is St. Paul's Cathedral, which was re-built after
the original was destroyed by fire in the year 1665.
The Houses of Parliament are also found in central London. These buildings are famous
for their Gothic architecture and for the sound of the large clock, known as "Big Ben."
The Tower of London, which was formerly used as a prison, is now a popular tourist
attraction. Buckingham Palace, the residence of the royal family, was first opened for
public viewing during the 1990s.
London is also famous for its many impressive museums, art galleries, and theatres. For
example, the British Museum contains priceless objects from all parts of the world. The
National Gallery holds a great collection of artistic masterpieces. The Globe Theatre has
been re-built to appear as it did during the time of Shakespeare.
Despite its age, London remains a vibrant and busy city. Most of the cultural and
financial institutions in England are located in London, and the city attracts many young
people from other parts of England and around the world. Of course, London is popular
with tourists who come to see the many attractions of this city.

Article #35
Soccer
Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. The basic rules of the sport are simple:
two teams of eleven players try to kick the soccer ball into the opposing team's goal.
Only one player on each team, the goal-keeper, is allowed to touch the ball with hands or
arms. Perhaps part of the reason for the popularity of soccer is its simplicity. The game
requires no expensive equipment, merely a ball and a playing surface, preferably a large
grassy area. For children in most parts of the world, soccer is the sport that is played
most widely.
Soccer is also known as football, especially in England. However, soccer should not be
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
32 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
confused with American Football, Australian Rules Football, and Rugby Football, which
are very different sports.
Although the basic rules of soccer are easy to learn, it is very difficult to master the skills
of the game. The best soccer players have developed, through natural talent and hard
work, a remarkable ability to control the soccer ball with their feet, knees, torso, and
head. They can pass the ball very accurately, or shoot the ball very hard.
The most famous soccer tournament is the World Cup. Every four years, teams
representing countries from around the world play in a tournament to decide which
country has the best soccer team in the world.
Because soccer is such a popular sport, it is not possible for every country in the world
to be represented at the World Cup tournament. To decide which countries may
participate in the World Cup, it is necessary to have tournaments within various regions
of the world. The countries that perform well within their parts of the world can then
proceed to the World Cup. In the past, most of the available places at the World Cup have
been reserved for teams from Europe and from South America. The reason for this is that
soccer has been extremely popular in these continents, which have produced the
winning teams in previous World Cup tournaments.
Recently, however, several African and Asian countries have played quite well at the
World Cup, so there are now additional places provided for teams from Africa and Asia.
Someday, teams from these areas will win the World Cup. However, there will no doubt
be strong competition from countries that have traditionally had very strong teams, such
as Argentina, England, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands.
In many parts of the world, soccer has been an increasingly popular sport for women.
There are now many soccer leagues and tournaments available for women athletes, and
it seems likely that the number of women who play soccer will someday equal the
number of men who play soccer. Among children in many parts of the world, soccer is
equally popular for boys and girls.

Article #36
Extinctions
Ever since human beings appeared on the Earth, we have had a serious impact on other
living things. One of the most serious results of the human presence has been the
extinction of other species. Since the arrival of humans, many species of animals and
plants have died out as a result of human activity.
The extinction of species is a serious problem. When certain species are eliminated, this
may disrupt the balance of nature, leading to overpopulation of some species and
extinction of others. These changes may have an impact on humans. Also, some of the
species that become extinct might have had benefits for human beings. For example,
scientists believe that some of the plants growing in rain forest areas might be valuable
for treating human diseases. If these plants become extinct as a result of human activity,
then these treatments will never be found.
The earliest extinctions caused by humans occurred very long ago. Modern humans
emerged in Africa over 100,000 years ago, and some of those people migrated to other
parts of the world. When they reached new areas, they found that it was very easy to hunt
the large animals, which had not previously been hunted by humans. As these
prehistoric people moved into Europe, Australia, and the Americas, they killed large
numbers of large animals. Within a few hundred years, many species of animals had
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
33 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
become extinct. For example, prehistoric people reached New Zealand less than 1000
years ago, but they soon hunted a huge bird, called the giant moa, to extinction.
With the beginnings of modern technology, several hundred years ago, many other
species were driven to extinction. Hunters armed with guns were able to kill vast
numbers of animals. In North America, this led to the extinction of bird species such as
the passenger pigeon, which had previously been very numerous. Other species were
nearly wiped out, such as the large prairie mammals called bison. There were once
millions of these animals, but now only a few thousand remain.
Today, many more species of animals and plants are going extinct. Sometimes this
happens because of human expansion into areas that are the habitat of certain species.
When people clear a forest, some species may be lost.
In the near future, many other extinctions are possible or likely. In some cases, the
problem is due to human greed. For example, some people buy ivory that is taken from
the bodies of animals such as elephants or rhinoceros. Hunters sometimes kill these
animals simply to take their ivory, and the result is a tragic decline in populations.
Another example involves bears in North America. Some people buy the sexual organs of
these animals for use as aphrodisiacs, or sexual stimulants. The result is that hunters kill
bears simply to obtain these organs, and this leads to a reduction in the number of bears.
Fortunately, many countries have laws to prevent the hunting of species that are facing
extinction, known as "endangered species." However, some hunting of these endangered
animals continues. Only by refusing to buy the products that are made from endangered
species can we prevent this terrible crime.

Article #37
Obesity and Nutrition
For people in many countries, one of the great triumphs of modern life is that there is a
great abundance of food. In those places, problems such as starvation and malnutrition
are no longer prevalent, and people do not worry about going hungry.
Despite the fact that there is plenty of food in modern countries, people still face many
health problems that are related to their diet. One problem is that modern technology has
made it possible to produce cheap and tasty food that is not very healthy. This leads to
the problem that many people are obese, or very overweight.
One example of this is the "fast food" that is served by many restaurants. This food is
often cooked by frying. Fried food contains a high proportion of fat. Also, fast food meals
are often very large. When people frequently eat large amounts of fried "fast food," they
will likely eat too much fat. This excess can lead to weight gain. Of course, many people
enjoy the taste of fried fast food and like to eat it occasionally. However, eating this kind
of food too often is bad for one's health.
Another example of health problems caused by modern food products involves soft
drinks and other sweetened beverages. These drinks, sometimes called "pop," have a
sweet taste that many people enjoy on occasion. However, these drinks contain large
amounts of sugar. When people drink soft drinks very frequently, they consume a great
deal of sugar. This excess sugar can lead to weight gain.
The weight gain that can result from consuming too much fast food and too many soft
drinks can have several harmful effects. For example, people who are very obese have an
increased risk of heart disease and of diabetes. Of course, fast food and soft drinks are
not the only causes of obesity. Other eating habits may be involved, and so are lack of
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
34 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
exercise and genetic factors.
To avoid the health problems that are associated with obesity, it is important that one
does not eat too much food. However, this does not mean that one should try to eat as
little as possible. People need an adequate amount of food in order to stay healthy. Also,
it is important to avoid new "fad" diets that become popular from time to time, because
these are often unsafe. Some of the diets that are recommended in popular books do not
contain adequate amounts of nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals.
Instead, one should try to eat foods that are nutritious. For example, foods such as fruits,
vegetables, grains, and lean meats have many vitamins and minerals that are needed for
good health. People whose diet consists mainly of these foods will probably be much
healthier, on average, than people whose diet contains too many foods that have high
levels of fat or sugar. In addition, many of these nutritious foods are also very tasty and
enjoyable to eat!

Article #38
Sexual Harassment
When an employee is subjected to unwanted sexual advances or comments by a co-
worker or an employer, we say that the employee is experiencing sexual harassment. In
some workplaces, sexual harassment is a serious problem.
In its most blatant form, a boss may demand sexual favours from an employee and
threaten to fire the employee if she fails to comply. Similarly, the employer might promise
a promotion or raise in exchange for some sexual favor. Whenever an employer uses the
prospect of reward or punishment as a way of obtaining sexual access to an employee,
sexual harassment has occurred.
This is not the only form of sexual harassment. Sometimes, an employee may be
subjected to demeaning comments by her employer or co-worker. For example, a boss
might make vulgar comments about the physical appearance of the employee. Another
example is that a co-worker might make remarks that speculate about the sexual
behaviour of the employee. In both of these cases, the employee is treated
disrespectfully on the basis of her sex, so both cases would represent sexual
harassment.
Some forms of sexual harassment are more subtle. If a group of workers exchanges
offensive jokes of a sexual nature, in such a way that they can be easily overheard by
other workers, then this is also a form of sexual harassment. Similarly, if workers post
pornographic pictures in their workplace, in such a way that they can be seen by other
workers, then this also represents sexual harassment. In both cases, the workplace
becomes an environment in which the employee is made to feel uncomfortable because
of her sex.
Sexual harassment usually involves a female employee who is being bothered by a male
employer or co-worker. In some cases, a woman might sexually harass a man, or one
person might sexually harass another person of the same sex. However, these cases are
not as common. Also, in some cases, the person who commits sexual harassment is not
a boss or co-worker, but a customer or a visitor to the workplace.
Sexual harassment is a form of intimidation and abuse of power that causes much stress
for many employees. In recent years, many steps have been taken to reduce the
occurrence of sexual harassment. Educational campaigns have been designed to teach
people that sexual harassment is wrong. Stronger penalties for sexual harassment have
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
35 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
been introduced.
Another way to reduce the prevalence of sexual harassment is to develop a culture of
respect in the workplace. People need to be aware of how their jokes or comments might
be perceived by others, and to imagine how they would feel if one of their relatives were
subjected to sexual harassment. Employers and employees must recognize that sexual
harassment is a serious concern and treat potential cases of sexual harassment very
seriously. Each company should have clear policies about sexual harassment, and each
should establish a fair and efficient process for dealing with complaints of this kind. In
this way, the workplace can be a comfortable environment for all persons.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #39
Cultural Differences : Individualism and Collectivism
The many cultures of the world differ in a great variety of ways. One of the most
interesting ways in which cultures vary is in the extent to which they are "individualistic"
or "collectivistic." An individualist society and a collectivist society are different in many
ways.
In an individualistic culture, each person tends to think of himself or herself in terms of
his or her own characteristics and preferences-the things that make the person unique or
different from others. In a collectivistic culture, each person tends to think of himself or
herself in terms of his or her social relationships and roles-the things that make the
person a part of a larger group, such as an extended family or an ethnic group.
Another difference between individualist and collectivist cultures involves the tendency
to help others. In an individualist society, people feel some obligation to help persons
who share some group identity-such as their distant relatives, or persons from the same
town-but this obligation is not nearly as strong as in collectivist cultures. On the other
hand, people in collectivist cultures tend to feel very little inclination to help other people
who do not belong to their groups, whereas people in individualist cultures are more
often willing to help others even if they do not belong to the same group.
Another difference between individualist and collectivist cultures involves the
relationship between people and the groups to which they belong. In an individualist
culture, people usually join or leave groups when it is in their personal interest to do so.
In a collectivist culture, people usually stay with one group for a long time. For example,
people in individualist societies are more willing to quit their job, and take a new job at
another company. People in collectivist societies usually prefer to stay with one company
throughout their career. Similarly, people in individualist countries usually get married
for reasons of personal choice, and are more likely to get divorced. However, people in
collectivist societies usually get married according to the wishes of their relatives, and
are less likely to get divorced.
Western countries, such as those of western Europe and North America, are usually
considered to be very individualist. However, not all individualist countries are similar in
every way. For example, the individualism of the United States is viewed as more
"competitive" than that of socialist countries, such as Sweden. In contrast to Western
countries, the countries of most parts of Asia and Africa are usually considered to be
very collectivist. Collectivist countries also differ from each other in many ways.
The idea of individualism versus collectivism is an interesting way to understand some
of the differences between cultures. By learning about ideas like this, one can better
appreciate the customs of other peoples.

Article #40
The Protestant Reformation
Until about 500 years ago, there was only one Christian church in western and central
Europe. People from Portugal to Poland all belonged to the Roman Catholic Church.
However, soon after the year 1500, people in many parts of Europe broke away from the
Roman Catholic Church and began their own churches instead. This was known as the
Protestant Reformation.
The leader of the early Protestant movement was a German theologian named Martin
Luther. Luther believed that many of the priests of the Roman Catholic Church had
become too concerned about wealth and luxury. Also, he disapproved of some practices
in the Church. One such practice was that priests allowed people to pay money to the
Church in exchange for committing various sins. Luther believed that it was wrong to
allow people to buy the freedom to commit acts that were against the teachings of the
Church.
Luther began to criticize the Roman Catholic Church in public, and he refused to
acknowledge the authority of the Church. He said that instead he would follow the
teachings of the Bible as he understood them. The officials of the Church declared that
Luther was a heretic. However, the local German rulers did not punish Luther. Many of
them resented the power of the Church and welcomed his ideas.
Luther and other Protestant leaders disagreed with the Church on several important
issues. The Protestants believed that priests should be allowed to marry, whereas the
Roman Catholic Church believed that priests should remain celibate. The Protestants
believed that people should read the Bible for themselves, whereas the Roman Catholic
Church believed that priests should interpret the Bible for the people.
During the decades that followed Luther, the Protestant movement spread throughout
much of Europe. Over time, many different Protestant churches were formed. During this
period, many wars were fought between local rulers who favoured Protestantism, and
other local rulers who supported the Roman Catholic Church. In the end, many parts of
Europe became Protestant, such as Scandinavia, England, and parts of Germany, Holland,
and Switzerland.
However, the people and rulers of many other areas of Europe preferred to remain in the
Roman Catholic Church. These areas included most of southern Europe, as well as
Poland and Ireland. The Roman Catholic Church changed a few of its practices in
response to Protestant criticism, but kept its most important beliefs.
In recent times, relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the various Protestant
churches have become much more friendly. Some discussions have been held between
Catholic and Protestant officials, in order to resolve some of their disagreements.

Modern Engineering Wonders
During the twentieth century, there were great improvements in engineering technology.
These new developments allowed the construction of many amazing tunnels, bridges,
towers, and office buildings.
For centuries, people had dreamed about the possibility of connecting the island of Great
Britain to the mainland of Europe. However, it was only in 1994 that such a link was
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
37 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
completed, when a tunnel was dug under the English Channel, between England and
France. The Channel Tunnel, also known as the "Chunnel," actually consists of three
separate railway tunnels. These tunnels are about 50 kilometres long. They are located
about 150 metres below the bottom of the sea. Obviously, this was an extremely
challenging project to undertake. As a result of the Chunnel, it is now possible to travel
between London and Paris by train. And the trip takes only three hours, of which only 20
minutes are spent inside the tunnel!
A suspension bridge is a bridge that is supported by strong wires that hang from tall
towers. The world's longest suspension bridge is the Akashi-Kaikyo bridge, near the city
of Kobe, Japan. This bridge is nearly 4 kilometres long, and the two towers near the
middle of the bridge are about 2 kilometres apart! It took almost 20 years to design this
bridge, and 10 years to build it. This bridge was designed to withstand extremely strong
winds, because Japan often experiences wind storms called typhoons. The bridge was
also designed to withstand powerful earthquakes, which sometimes hit Japan.
At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the world's tallest free-standing tower was
the Canadian National Tower, or the CN Tower. The CN tower is 553 metres tall. It is
located in the city of Toronto, within the Canadian province of Ontario. This structure was
built in 1975 as a television and radio tower. Before the CN tower was built, TV and radio
reception in the Toronto area was poor. This was because the TV and radio signals were
blocked by the buildings of downtown Toronto. When the CN tower was built, this
problem was solved. Of course, the CN tower is also a famous tourist attraction. People
can ride in the very fast elevators that take them to observation areas, which are at about
350 and 450 metres above the ground.
Although the CN Tower is the world's tallest tower, it is not an office building. The tallest
buildings in the world are the Petronas Towers, in the city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
and the Sears Tower, in the American city of Chicago. The Sears Tower, which is 442
metres tall, was completed in 1974. It has 110 floors, and its top floor is the highest office
floor in the world. However, the Petronas Towers reach slightly higher, to a height of 452
metres. The Petronas Towers were completed in 1998.
Obviously, the late twentieth century witnessed some amazing achievements of
engineering. It will be very interesting to see what new wonders will be constructed in the
twenty-first century!

Article #42
Anne Sullivan and Helen Keller
The story of Anne Sullivan and Helen Keller is the story of a dedicated teacher and an
eager student. This story is very remarkable and inspiring because the teaching was
done without sight and without sound.
Helen Keller was born in the American state of Alabama in 1880. She was a happy and
healthy baby, but before she reached the age of two, she was struck by a severe fever. As
a result of this fever, she became both deaf and blind.
After her illness, the young Helen Keller learned to use her other senses. For example,
she touched other people's hands to figure out what they were doing. In this way, she
also learned that people could communicate by moving their lips. Helen could not talk;
instead, she communicated with her family by making sign movements with her hands
and body. However, Helen became very frustrated by her inability to see, hear, and talk.
She often became very angry and had many "temper tantrums."
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
38 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
When Helen Keller was six years old, her family took her to see Dr. Alexander Graham
Bell, who was an expert on educating deaf children. (This man was also famous for
inventing the telephone.) As a result of this visit, Helen's parents hired a tutor for their
daughter. The tutor was a very intelligent deaf woman named Anne Sullivan.
At first, it was difficult to teach Helen because she still made many angry outbursts.
Gradually, Anne Sullivan gained Helen's trust. One day, Anne began to teach Helen to
communicate. Anne took Helen to a well and pumped some water onto Helen's hand.
Then, Anne used her finger to write the letters w-a-t-e-r onto Helen's hand. By repeating
this, Anne was able to teach Helen how to write the word "water."
As soon as Helen learned that things could be named in this way, she wanted to learn the
names of many other objects and actions. She was curious about many things, and
learned a great number of words. She also learned to read by using the Braille alphabet.
This alphabet allows the reader to feel letters and words, which are represented by
bumps on a page. Also, Helen learned to talk, by feeling and then copying the
movements of people's mouths.
When Helen Keller was 16 years old, Anne Sullivan went with her to college. Anne acted
as Helen's interpreter, and Helen was very successful in her studies. After her graduation,
Helen dedicated her life to improving conditions for the blind, the deaf, and the poor.
Anne Sullivan died in 1936 and was remembered as the "Miracle Worker" for her triumph
in educating Helen Keller.
After Anne's death, Helen continued to give lectures in countries around the world, and
was active in many political causes. She met with presidents and prime ministers, and
helped to improve conditions for people who were deaf or blind. At the time of her death,
in 1968, Helen Keller was one of the most admired people in the world.

Article #43
The Automobile, or Car
In many ways, the automobile has been one of the most important inventions of the
modern age. People have been able to travel much more freely, and across much greater
distances, than was possible in the past. The automobile, which most people refer to as
the "car," has also had some harmful consequences, such as pollution and accidents.
However, it is clear that life has changed profoundly as a result of the car.
Modern cars are very complicated, but the basic idea of how a car works can be
described briefly. When the keys are turned in the ignition of the car, this creates a spark
that ignites some gasoline vapour inside a cylinder. Then, the rapid expansion of this
vapour pushes against a part called a piston. The movement of the piston then causes a
turning motion in a shaft that is connected to the wheels. The wheels turn, and the car
moves.
The invention of the car, and the engines used by cars, happened gradually in the late
nineteenth century, mainly in France and Germany. In the early twentieth century, an
American engineer named Henry Ford developed a new way of making cars. Instead of
having one worker produce an entire car, he had each worker perform one part of the
production of many different cars. This system was very efficient and allowed the mass
production of cars. The first car to be produced in large numbers was called the "Model
T."
The Model T Ford and other cars that were soon produced in large numbers were cheap
enough that many people could afford to buy them. Many new roads were built and
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
39 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
paved throughout North America to allow cars to be driven from town to town. People
were able to travel much more easily and to visit places that had previously been difficult
to reach.
Some problems also came with the widespread use of cars. One of these problems was
air pollution, because car engines burn gasoline, which produces poisonous exhaust
fumes. Gradually, new laws and new technology have led to reductions in the air
pollution that is caused by cars. Moreover, cars today are much more "fuel efficient" than
they were in the past, requiring less gasoline to travel a given distance. However, this
pollution is still a problem because of the many millions of cars that are used each day.
Another problem has been car accidents, which have caused many thousands of deaths
each year. During the 1960s, some journalists brought attention to the unsafe features of
many cars. As a result, the safety of cars has been greatly improved. In addition, the use
of seat belts is now required by law. However, car accidents continue to be a serious
problem.
The future is likely to bring many interesting new changes to the car. Improvements in
the safety of cars, in fuel efficiency, and in the cleanliness of car emissions are
continuing to be made. Also, the increasing use of the car in economically developing
countries will probably have important effects upon people's lives around the world.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #44
Sexual Attitude and Behavior
During the past several decades, there have been major changes within most Western
countries in people's attitudes toward sex, and in sexual behaviour. For people who have
lived throughout this period, the changes have seemed quite remarkable.
Until the early twentieth century, people in most Western countries did not have
permissive attitudes regarding sexuality. For the most part, young people were expected
to wait until marriage before having sexual intercourse. Of course, some premarital sex
did occur, and prostitution was not rare. However, sexual behaviour was relatively
restricted.
As the twentieth century progressed, there was a gradual trend toward liberalization of
attitudes toward sex. However, this trend was greatly speeded after 1960, when the first
birth control pills became available. These contraceptive pills made it possible for
women to engage in sexual intercourse without much risk of an unwanted pregnancy. As
a result, many women were more willing to have premarital sex than was previously the
case.
Also during the 1960s, Western countries were reaching high levels of wealth and
education. A new and very large generation of young people was approaching adulthood,
and there was a mood of rebellion against traditional norms. There was an increase in
the number of people who engaged in sex before marriage, and also a greater openness
about such behaviour.
By the 1970s, sexual attitudes had become quite liberal, and many young people were
quite promiscuous in their sexual behaviour. However, this pattern reversed somewhat
during the 1980s. There was increased concern about sexually transmitted diseases,
including AIDS; moreover, many young women had been uncomfortable with the idea of
unrestricted sexual behaviour. As a result, sexual attitudes became slightly more
conservative during the 1980s and 1990s, although they remained much more liberal
than in previous decades.
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
40 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
In the early twenty-first century, most young people in Western countries begin having
sex during their high school years, although some people wait until they are
considerably older. Some young people are promiscuous, but most engage in
monogamous relationships that typically last for a period of several months or a few
years. When one relationship ends, another usually begins soon after. This pattern
usually continues until marriage. After marriage, most people have sex exclusively with
their spouse; however, some people do commit adultery.
Sexuality has changed a great deal in recent decades. It will be very interesting to see
how people's sexual attitudes and behaviour will change in the future.

Article #45
The Mississippi River
The Mississippi River is the longest river within the United States, and the fourth longest
river in the world. This river holds a special place in American history and literature, and
in the imagination of ordinary Americans.
The Mississippi River begins in the hills of northern Minnesota, near the Canadian border,
and flows southward about 3700 kilometres, through ten states, before draining its water
and silt into the Gulf of Mexico. Traditionally, the river is viewed as a natural boundary
between the eastern and western halves of the United States.
Until the year 1803, the areas to the west of the Mississippi River, and the areas around
the mouth of the river, were claimed by Spain and by France. In that year, the French
emperor, Napoleon, decided to sell this land to the United States of America. This sale,
which is called the Louisiana Purchase, was very important for the United States. By
controlling the Mississippi River, the Americans would be able to use it for transporting
goods and people in this rapidly developing area.
For many years, river-boats were the main method of long-distance transportation for
people living near the Mississippi. Steam-powered boats, with large "paddle wheels" that
pushed the boat forward, were very popular in the time before cars and airplanes.
One of the famous cities along the Mississippi River is St. Louis. This city is known as
the "gateway to the west." During the nineteenth century, St. Louis was the last large
town that people would pass through on their way to new farmland farther west. Today,
St. Louis is famous for the "Gateway Arch," a tall monument that welcomes people to the
west. St. Louis is also known as the city where the music known as "the Blues" began.
Near the mouth of the Mississippi River is another famous city, New Orleans. In terms of
the style of buildings, New Orleans is said to be the most unusual American city, because
it is influenced so strongly by Spanish and French traditions. Even today, the traditional
festival of "Mardi Gras" is celebrated in New Orleans each year. New Orleans and the
surrounding areas of the state of Louisiana are famous for spicy "Cajun" food. This style
of cooking was developed by the French-speaking settlers of Louisiana.
The Mississippi River is famous in many stories of American literature. For example, The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, which were written by the author Mark
Twain, are both set along the Mississippi River.
Today, the federal and state governments of the United States are working to preserve
the natural environment along the Mississippi River. People recognize the importance of
keeping this river healthy and clean.

Doctors Without Borders
In 1999, the Nobel Prize for Peace was won by the organization known as "Doctors
Without Borders." This is the English name of the organization, based in Belgium, which
won the prize for its humanitarian assistance to people around the world, in areas that
have been struck by disaster.
The fundamental ideas of Doctors Without Borders is that people who suffer from a
disaster have the right to receive professional help as soon as possible. The organization
helps people regardless of their nationality, race, religion, ethnicity, sex, or political
opinions. Also, the assistance provided by Doctors Without Borders is given in response
to all kinds of disasters, such as famines, earthquakes, and wars.
The people who belong to Doctors Without Borders are experienced medical workers
who volunteer their time, effort, and skills in an attempt to help people who are in need.
These volunteers include doctors, nurses, surgeons, anesthetists, laboratory technicians,
and other medical workers. There are also some non-medical volunteers who work for
Doctors Without Borders in positions of administration or logistics.
Volunteers must first take a course before participating in a humanitarian mission. They
promise to abide by a code of professional ethics, and they promise to remain neutral in
any conflicts within a disaster area. A mission typically lasts about six months, but the
duration varies. The volunteers are insured by the organization, but they are not paid in
any way for their work.
When Doctors Without Borders began in 1971, it consisted of only a few French doctors
who wanted to provide humanitarian aid to people in disaster areas. Over the years, it
grew rapidly, and by 2001, Doctors Without Borders had 2500 volunteers working in 80
countries around the world. They have helped people by providing emergency health
care, vaccinations, medicine, water, and basic food, and also by developing improved
water and sanitation systems. In many areas, Doctors Without Borders has also helped
to provide basic medical training to local people.
Although Doctors Without Borders remains neutral in any conflicts within a disaster area,
the organization does speak out against abuses of human rights. By remaining
independent of the influence of governments and corporations, Doctors Without Borders
is able to criticize the people and organizations who cause suffering. The volunteers are
witnesses who tell the world about the cruelty that is inflicted upon innocent people.
Obviously, the work of Doctors Without Borders is extremely important. The volunteers
of this organization are brave and selfless people whose efforts have relieved the
suffering of millions of people.

Chicago
Chicago is one of the most famous American cities. Some cities in the United States-
such as New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco-may be more glamorous, but many
people agree that Chicago is the city that best represents the United States.
Located in the middle of North America, Chicago has derived much benefit from its
geography. The city's central location has made its O'Hare International Airport the "hub"
for most airlines in the United States. Its location on the shores of Lake Michigan has
made it a major port and business centre, where the agricultural and industrial products
of the American Midwest are shipped overseas.

Until about the 1830s, Chicago was a minor trading post. But then it grew rapidly as the
most important town in the rapidly developing areas of the midwestern United States. In
1871, the city was destroyed by a fire. It is often said that the fire started when a cow
knocked over an oil lamp. It took about 20 years for the city to be completely rebuilt, but
it continued to expand. In 1882, the first skyscraper was built in Chicago.
Around the turn of the century, the population of Chicago was growing quickly. Many
African-American people moved to Chicago from the southern United States, and many
immigrants from Eastern Europe also arrived in Chicago during this time. Because of the
busy and active atmosphere of the city, an American poet described Chicago as "the city
of broad shoulders."
Chicago became notorious for organized crime during the Prohibition Era of the 1920s,
when the sale of alcohol was illegal. Mobsters such as Al Capone became rich by
smuggling liquor, and many people were killed in conflicts between rival gangs of
criminals. But the influence of organized crime later became weaker.
In the decades following World War Two, Chicago experienced some problems with
crime, poverty, and racial conflict. However, the city has recently prospered, and social
conditions have improved for many people in Chicago. Compared with other large cities,
Chicago is viewed as an affordable place to live, with a high quality of life. The city has
efficient transportation, and many beautiful parks along the Lake Michigan shoreline.
Chicago is famous for its many attractions, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the
Field Museum of Natural History, the Shedd Aquarium, the Sears Tower, and the "Miracle
Mile" shopping district. Indeed, Chicago is one of the most interesting cities in the United
States.

Article #48
Women and the Right to Vote
In most countries today, people think it is obvious that all adults should have the right to
vote in democratic elections. But it was not so long ago that women did not have this
right. Only after a long struggle did women gain the right to vote.
By the early nineteenth century, modern democratic forms of government were
appearing in the United States, Great Britain, and some European countries. In these
countries, most adult men had the right to vote in democratic elections. Some men were
denied this right if they were poor or if they belonged to a racial minority group, but
gradually this right was extended to all men.
It took much longer for women to gain the right to vote. Only in special cases, such as
that of a widow who owned land, could a woman be allowed to vote. Many men believed
that it was not necessary for women to vote, because they assumed that the husband
should decide on behalf of his wife. Some men believed that women did not possess the
intelligence or the discipline to vote carefully. Some women also believed that women
should not be involved in politics, but many others wanted the right to vote.
By about the year 1850, some women began to organize in an effort to change the laws
regarding women and the vote. This movement was known as the "woman suffrage"
movement, because the word "suffrage" means voting. Leaders such as Susan B.
Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton brought attention to this issue, and persuaded
many people that women should vote.
The first part of the United States to recognize women's right to vote was Wyoming, in
the year 1869. During the following decades, many other states recognized women's right
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
43 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
to vote, particularly in the western part of the country, where women had a high social
status. However, the United States was not the first country to recognize women's right
to vote at the national level.
The first country to recognize women's right to vote was New Zealand, in 1893. Soon
after, Australia also allowed women to vote, and so did the Scandinavian countries of
northern Europe. But in countries such as the United States, Canada, and Great Britain,
women could not yet vote. Women in those countries struggled to gain the vote. For
example, in Great Britain, Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters participated in hunger
strikes.
During World War One (1914-1918), women's work efforts were very important to winning
the war, and people's attitudes were increasingly in favor of women having the right to
vote. Women then gained the right to vote in Canada, the United States, and Great Britain.
Gradually, other democracies around the world also recognized women's right to vote.
Today, it seems difficult to believe that women were not allowed to vote only a few
generations ago. But there is still progress to be made. In most countries, women are
under-represented among political leaders. Perhaps the day will soon come when women
are elected as often as men.

Article #49
Charles Dickens
Charles Dickens is considered one of the greatest writers in the history of English
literature. Dickens wrote his many novels during the nineteenth century, but those novels
remain popular even today. Literary experts admire his genius at describing the lives and
personalities of the many characters in his books.
Charles Dickens was born in England in 1812. His father was a clerk who worked for the
Navy. Unfortunately, his father was not good at managing money, and the family soon
went deeply into debt. In those days, people who owed money were sent to prison, and
their families were sent to places called "workhouses." When Charles's father was
unable to pay the debts, Charles was sent to a workhouse, where he had to work long
hours, and Charles's father was sent to prison. After a few years, the family regained its
freedom, but the experience had a lasting effect upon Charles.
As a young man, Charles Dickens worked as a journalist in the law courts and in
Parliament. But he soon began writing stories for newspapers. These stories were very
popular with the readers. Soon, Dickens began writing entire novels for the newspapers.
Each month, the newspaper would publish another chapter of Dickens's latest novel.
One of Dickens's most famous early novels is called Oliver Twist. This is the story of a
young man who is poor and alone in the city of London, and becomes involved in
criminal activities to support himself. The characters in this novel have a very wide range
of personalities, but seem very real to the reader. This book exposed the conditions that
faced the poor people of London, and helped to encourage reforms aimed at improving
those conditions.
Perhaps Dickens's most popular novel is A Christmas Carol. In this story, a rich but
stingy old man, Ebenezer Scrooge, refuses to give his employee a day off work at
Christmas, and refuses to donate money to help the poor. But, while sleeping, Scrooge is
visited by ghosts from his past, present and future. These ghosts show Scrooge how
badly he has behaved. When Scrooge wakes up, he becomes a kind and generous man
who fully appreciates the spirit of the Christmas holiday.

Another famous novel of Dickens is A Tale of Two Cities. This is a story of the violence
and upheaval during the French Revolution. The story is famous for the heroic act of
sacrifice that is made by one character for the benefit of the others.
Dickens was famous as a public speaker, and large crowds assembled to hear his
performances. When he died in 1870, he was a very famous man.
The novels of Charles Dickens allow the reader to experience the life of nineteenth
century London, showing the poverty and injustice that were so common. The characters
of these novels show the range of human behaviour, from cruelty and selfishness to
kindness and love. It is no surprise that Dickens is viewed as one of the great figures of
English literature.

Article #50
Samuel Clemens, or Mark Twain
Mark Twain was the author of some of the greatest works of American English literature,
such as Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
Mark Twain's real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens. He used Mark Twain as his
"pen name".
Samuel Clemens was born in the American state of Missouri in 1835. As a child he
enjoyed many outdoor activities, such as swimming and fishing. When Samuel was
eleven years old, his father died, and he began working to help support his family.
As a young man, Samuel Clemens began to write stories for newspapers. However, he
took a job working as a navigator on the steamboats that travelled up and down the
Mississippi River. Clemens greatly enjoyed this period of his life, during which time he
gained much knowledge about life on the river. He also learned much about human
behaviour by observing the many people on the boats and along the river. It was as a
result of this time that Clemens began using his pen name, Mark Twain. This name is
taken from a term that was used by the men who worked on the river. It is used to
describe water that is just deep enough to be navigated safely.
The earliest of Mark Twain's really famous novels was The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
This novel describes a boy who engages in much mischief, but who has a kind heart. The
story contains several scenes that are quite funny. In one of these, Tom is working at the
boring task of painting a fence. He persuades several other boys to help him, by
pretending that painting the fence is a fun and enjoyable activity.
Another famous novel by Mark Twain was Life on the Mississippi. This book describes
many interesting characters similar to those that Twain actually observed while working
on a steamboat. This story gives the reader a vivid image of the people who lived and
worked along the Mississippi River.
Probably the best novel by Mark Twain was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This
novel tells the story of a boy who runs away from his violent father. The boy, whose
name is Huckleberry Finn, is joined in his escape by a man named Jim. Jim is a slave
who has decided to run away from his owners. Huck and Jim travel north along the
Mississippi, hoping to reach the areas where slavery is not allowed. In this story, the
reader can experience the moral sense of Huckleberry, who must make several important
decisions during the escape.
Mark Twain died in 1910, after writing many more novels and many stories of his travels
around the world. Twain's works are still widely read today. His books are appreciated for
their humor, for their interesting descriptions of life in nineteenth century America, and
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

for showing both the good and evil that people can do. Many critics consider Twain to
have been the greatest American writer.

The Islands of the Caribbean
The Caribbean Sea is the large body of water that lies north of the northern tip of South
America. Within the Caribbean sea are many islands that have played an important role
in the history and culture of the Western hemisphere.
By far the largest island in the Caribbean is Cuba. Cuba was formerly a colony of Spain,
but became independent in 1902. Cuba became a Communist country in 1959, when a
revolution overthrew an unpopular government. After the revolution, many Cubans fled
to the United States. Today, the American city of Miami, in the state of Florida, has been
greatly influenced by Cuban culture. Tobacco is widely grown in Cuba, and the country is
famous for the cigars that are produced in the capital city, Havana.
The island of Hispaniola is located just east of Cuba. This island is divided into two
countries. In the west is Haiti, where the people speak a variety of the French language
that has been influenced by African languages. In the east is the Dominican Republic,
where the people speak Spanish.
Another important Caribbean island is Puerto Rico. This was previously a Spanish colony,
but it is now governed by the United States. Many people from Puerto Rico have moved
to the mainland United States, especially the New York area.
In many other islands in the Caribbean, English is the main language. The largest of
these islands is Jamaica, which is located just south of Cuba. Most Jamaicans are the
descendants of African people who were brought to work as slaves on sugar plantations.
Jamaica is famous as the birthplace of the style of music called "reggae," which was
popularized in other countries by Bob Marley, a famous Jamaican musician.
Another important English-speaking Caribbean island is Trinidad. This island is located
just north of South America. The population of Trinidad is very diverse. The largest
groups of people are descended from people who came from Africa and India, but there
are many other nationalities also. Trinidad is famous for a style of music known as
"calypso," and for musicians who produce pleasant sounds by playing steel drums.
There are also many other, smaller islands in the Caribbean, each with its own unique
features. Many of these islands possess fine beaches, and are popular tourist
destinations. The warm weather of the Caribbean makes it a popular place for North
Americans who must live through cold winters!

Article #52
North American Indians
The first people who lived in North America were the Indians. The name "Indians" is
actually not very accurate, because the people are not from India. But when the first
Europeans came to North America, they mistakenly believed that they had reached India,
so they referred to the people as Indians. In different parts of North America, the Indians
had very different cultures and very different ways of making a living.
On the west coast of North America, many large rivers flow into the Pacific Ocean. In
these rivers is an abundance of fish, such as salmon. The Indians in these areas
obtained much of their food by fishing. They lived in settled villages, and became experts
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
46 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
in carving wood from the tall trees of the area. They carved large canoes for traveling on
the rivers and oceans, and they also carved tall "totem poles." Totem poles were
carvings of various animal or human figures, and often the poles had a mythical or
spiritual significance for the people who carved them. Many beautiful totem poles can be
seen in cities such as Vancouver or Victoria, in the Canadian state of British Columbia; or
Seattle, in the American state of Washington.
The Plains Indians lived in the central prairie of North America. The various nations of
the Plains lived by hunting large animals called buffalo, or bison. Horses were brought to
North America in the sixteenth century by the Spanish. The Indians who lived in the
prairie areas had learned to become experts at riding horses, and on horseback they
could hunt the giant herds of bison. They followed the buffalo from place to place. The
Plains Indians lived in portable houses called "teepees," which were made by sewing
together buffalo skins, and holding them in place with wooden poles.
In the southwestern United States, some Indians lived by farming. In this dry area, the
Indians raised several crops, such as corn, beans, and squash. Many of the Indians in
these areas lived in large settlements, where the houses were made from stone or dried
mud. The people were experts at weaving, and they made clothing and blankets that had
beautiful artistic designs.
Near the eastern coast of North America, many Indians lived by a combination of farming
and hunting. These people lived in fortified villages, some of which were inhabited for
many years at a time. In some places, they built large earthworks that can still be seen
today.
In the forests of northern Canada, the Indians lived primarily by hunting, fishing, and
gathering. Like the Indians of the prairie regions, they often moved from place to place in
search of game animals to hunt.
Today, the Indians of North America no longer live in their traditional ways. However,
several Indian languages are still spoken by many thousands of people. Also, many
Indians in the United States and Canada are very interested in maintaining the cultural
traditions of their ancestors.
