Rain makes the flowers and grass grow.

It might be very gusty so that the wind pushes you.  
It is dangerous if the wind is very strong.  
A hurricane or tornado is very dangerous.

Sometimes, the weatherman will say that there will be snow flurries.  
Sometimes, there is just a light dusting of snow.  
Sometimes, there is a blizzard or a snowstorm.  
It can be dangerous driving through a blizzard.  
If there is a lot of snow, the streets have to be plowed.  
You need a hat, coat, mittens and boots on a very cold day.  
Sometimes, the weather forecast is wrong.  
The weatherman might say that it will be a sunny day, but then the clouds come in and it rains.

I like to feel a gentle breeze to cool me down.*
