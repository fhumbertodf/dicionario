Article #49
Charles Dickens
Charles Dickens is considered one of the greatest writers in the history of English
literature. Dickens wrote his many novels during the nineteenth century, but those novels
remain popular even today. Literary experts admire his genius at describing the lives and
personalities of the many characters in his books.
Charles Dickens was born in England in 1812. His father was a clerk who worked for the
Navy. Unfortunately, his father was not good at managing money, and the family soon
went deeply into debt. In those days, people who owed money were sent to prison, and
their families were sent to places called "workhouses." When Charles's father was
unable to pay the debts, Charles was sent to a workhouse, where he had to work long
hours, and Charles's father was sent to prison. After a few years, the family regained its
freedom, but the experience had a lasting effect upon Charles.
As a young man, Charles Dickens worked as a journalist in the law courts and in
Parliament. But he soon began writing stories for newspapers. These stories were very
popular with the readers. Soon, Dickens began writing entire novels for the newspapers.
Each month, the newspaper would publish another chapter of Dickens's latest novel.
One of Dickens's most famous early novels is called Oliver Twist. This is the story of a
young man who is poor and alone in the city of London, and becomes involved in
criminal activities to support himself. The characters in this novel have a very wide range
of personalities, but seem very real to the reader. This book exposed the conditions that
faced the poor people of London, and helped to encourage reforms aimed at improving
those conditions.
Perhaps Dickens's most popular novel is A Christmas Carol. In this story, a rich but
stingy old man, Ebenezer Scrooge, refuses to give his employee a day off work at
Christmas, and refuses to donate money to help the poor. But, while sleeping, Scrooge is
visited by ghosts from his past, present and future. These ghosts show Scrooge how
badly he has behaved. When Scrooge wakes up, he becomes a kind and generous man
who fully appreciates the spirit of the Christmas holiday.

Another famous novel of Dickens is A Tale of Two Cities. This is a story of the violence
and upheaval during the French Revolution. The story is famous for the heroic act of
sacrifice that is made by one character for the benefit of the others.
Dickens was famous as a public speaker, and large crowds assembled to hear his
performances. When he died in 1870, he was a very famous man.
The novels of Charles Dickens allow the reader to experience the life of nineteenth
century London, showing the poverty and injustice that were so common. The characters
of these novels show the range of human behaviour, from cruelty and selfishness to
kindness and love. It is no surprise that Dickens is viewed as one of the great figures of
English literature.

Article #50
Samuel Clemens, or Mark Twain
Mark Twain was the author of some of the greatest works of American English literature,
such as Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
Mark Twain's real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens. He used Mark Twain as his
"pen name".
Samuel Clemens was born in the American state of Missouri in 1835. As a child he
enjoyed many outdoor activities, such as swimming and fishing. When Samuel was
eleven years old, his father died, and he began working to help support his family.
As a young man, Samuel Clemens began to write stories for newspapers. However, he
took a job working as a navigator on the steamboats that travelled up and down the
Mississippi River. Clemens greatly enjoyed this period of his life, during which time he
gained much knowledge about life on the river. He also learned much about human
behaviour by observing the many people on the boats and along the river. It was as a
result of this time that Clemens began using his pen name, Mark Twain. This name is
taken from a term that was used by the men who worked on the river. It is used to
describe water that is just deep enough to be navigated safely.
The earliest of Mark Twain's really famous novels was The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
This novel describes a boy who engages in much mischief, but who has a kind heart. The
story contains several scenes that are quite funny. In one of these, Tom is working at the
boring task of painting a fence. He persuades several other boys to help him, by
pretending that painting the fence is a fun and enjoyable activity.
Another famous novel by Mark Twain was Life on the Mississippi. This book describes
many interesting characters similar to those that Twain actually observed while working
on a steamboat. This story gives the reader a vivid image of the people who lived and
worked along the Mississippi River.
Probably the best novel by Mark Twain was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This
novel tells the story of a boy who runs away from his violent father. The boy, whose
name is Huckleberry Finn, is joined in his escape by a man named Jim. Jim is a slave
who has decided to run away from his owners. Huck and Jim travel north along the
Mississippi, hoping to reach the areas where slavery is not allowed. In this story, the
reader can experience the moral sense of Huckleberry, who must make several important
decisions during the escape.
Mark Twain died in 1910, after writing many more novels and many stories of his travels
around the world. Twain's works are still widely read today. His books are appreciated for
their humor, for their interesting descriptions of life in nineteenth century America, and

45 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
for showing both the good and evil that people can do. Many critics consider Twain to
have been the greatest American writer.

Article #51
The Islands of the Caribbean
The Caribbean Sea is the large body of water that lies north of the northern tip of South
America. Within the Caribbean sea are many islands that have played an important role
in the history and culture of the Western hemisphere.
By far the largest island in the Caribbean is Cuba. Cuba was formerly a colony of Spain,
but became independent in 1902. Cuba became a Communist country in 1959, when a
revolution overthrew an unpopular government. After the revolution, many Cubans fled
to the United States. Today, the American city of Miami, in the state of Florida, has been
greatly influenced by Cuban culture. Tobacco is widely grown in Cuba, and the country is
famous for the cigars that are produced in the capital city, Havana.
The island of Hispaniola is located just east of Cuba. This island is divided into two
countries. In the west is Haiti, where the people speak a variety of the French language
that has been influenced by African languages. In the east is the Dominican Republic,
where the people speak Spanish.
Another important Caribbean island is Puerto Rico. This was previously a Spanish colony,
but it is now governed by the United States. Many people from Puerto Rico have moved
to the mainland United States, especially the New York area.
In many other islands in the Caribbean, English is the main language. The largest of
these islands is Jamaica, which is located just south of Cuba. Most Jamaicans are the
descendants of African people who were brought to work as slaves on sugar plantations.
Jamaica is famous as the birthplace of the style of music called "reggae," which was
popularized in other countries by Bob Marley, a famous Jamaican musician.
Another important English-speaking Caribbean island is Trinidad. This island is located
just north of South America. The population of Trinidad is very diverse. The largest
groups of people are descended from people who came from Africa and India, but there
are many other nationalities also. Trinidad is famous for a style of music known as
"calypso," and for musicians who produce pleasant sounds by playing steel drums.
There are also many other, smaller islands in the Caribbean, each with its own unique
features. Many of these islands possess fine beaches, and are popular tourist
destinations. The warm weather of the Caribbean makes it a popular place for North
Americans who must live through cold winters!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #52
North American Indians
The first people who lived in North America were the Indians. The name "Indians" is
actually not very accurate, because the people are not from India. But when the first
Europeans came to North America, they mistakenly believed that they had reached India,
so they referred to the people as Indians. In different parts of North America, the Indians
had very different cultures and very different ways of making a living.
On the west coast of North America, many large rivers flow into the Pacific Ocean. In
these rivers is an abundance of fish, such as salmon. The Indians in these areas
obtained much of their food by fishing. They lived in settled villages, and became experts

46 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
in carving wood from the tall trees of the area. They carved large canoes for traveling on
the rivers and oceans, and they also carved tall "totem poles." Totem poles were
carvings of various animal or human figures, and often the poles had a mythical or
spiritual significance for the people who carved them. Many beautiful totem poles can be
seen in cities such as Vancouver or Victoria, in the Canadian state of British Columbia; or
Seattle, in the American state of Washington.
The Plains Indians lived in the central prairie of North America. The various nations of
the Plains lived by hunting large animals called buffalo, or bison. Horses were brought to
North America in the sixteenth century by the Spanish. The Indians who lived in the
prairie areas had learned to become experts at riding horses, and on horseback they
could hunt the giant herds of bison. They followed the buffalo from place to place. The
Plains Indians lived in portable houses called "teepees," which were made by sewing
together buffalo skins, and holding them in place with wooden poles.
In the southwestern United States, some Indians lived by farming. In this dry area, the
Indians raised several crops, such as corn, beans, and squash. Many of the Indians in
these areas lived in large settlements, where the houses were made from stone or dried
mud. The people were experts at weaving, and they made clothing and blankets that had
beautiful artistic designs.
Near the eastern coast of North America, many Indians lived by a combination of farming
and hunting. These people lived in fortified villages, some of which were inhabited for
many years at a time. In some places, they built large earthworks that can still be seen
today.
In the forests of northern Canada, the Indians lived primarily by hunting, fishing, and
gathering. Like the Indians of the prairie regions, they often moved from place to place in
search of game animals to hunt.
Today, the Indians of North America no longer live in their traditional ways. However,
several Indian languages are still spoken by many thousands of people. Also, many
Indians in the United States and Canada are very interested in maintaining the cultural
traditions of their ancestors.

Article #53
How the First World War Started
During the summer of 1914, many people in Europe felt very optimistic about the future.
Modern technology was improving people's lives. Political freedom was gradually
increasing in many countries. New artistic styles and scientific discoveries were being
made. But later that summer, a terrible war began.
In the early twentieth century, the various countries of Europe competed with each other
in an attempt to be the most powerful country on the continent. In each country, many of
the political leaders wanted to control more land, more people, and more resources.
The First World War began when the archduke of Austria-Hungary was assassinated.
Austria-Hungary wanted to punish the assassin, who was from the small country of
Serbia. This led to a serious dispute, and soon other countries were involved. Within a
few weeks, a war had begun. On one side were Germany and Austria-Hungary, and on the
other side were Russia, France, and Britain.
The people in these countries at first welcomed the news of a war. Many people were
intensely patriotic, and supported the war effort without thinking carefully about the
reasons for the war. Some people thought that war would bring adventure and glory to

47 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
their lives, and they cheered enthusiastically in the streets.
After the war started, it soon became clear that it was a terrible disaster. In the western
part of Europe, the opposing sides fought many bloody battles. Soldiers on both sides
lived in filthy trenches that had been dug out of the ground. Sometimes, hundreds of
thousands of men were killed in battles that lasted only a few days. In most cases, these
battles did not result in large gains or losses of territory.
The war continued for more than four years. When the war was finally over, millions of
people had been killed. Many people realized that their eagerness to fight against other
countries had led them into a great disaster. This disaster did not end when the war
ended in 1918. During the next thirty years, there would be many violent revolutions in
Europe, and a second major war that would be even worse than the first.
Today, people in most European countries no longer view other nations as enemies.
They have no interest in fighting wars with their neighbours. Instead, they are interested
in trading with the other countries, and in visiting those countries as tourists. The
lessons of the twentieth century have reminded people that wars can have terrible
consequences.

Article #54
Abraham Lincoln
When historians are asked to choose the greatest Presidents in the history of the United
States, one of the names most frequently mentioned is Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln was
President during the greatest ordeal that ever faced the United States-the Civil War.
Abraham Lincoln was born in 1809 in the state of Kentucky, but when he was a child, the
family moved to the state of Indiana. Abraham's parents, Thomas and Nancy Lincoln,
were farmers who were very poor, and they received only a few years of education. When
Abraham was only nine years old, his mother became ill and died. About one year later,
Abraham's father remarried.
As a young man, Abraham continued to work on the family farm, and he also worked as a
laborer. During this time, the Lincolns moved to the state of Illinois. Abraham became
known to the local people as an excellent athlete and story-teller. He educated himself by
reading many books, most of which he borrowed from neighbours.
Lincoln was interested in politics, and when he was in his mid-20s, he was elected to the
Illinois state legislature. During this time, Lincoln also studied law, and soon became
known as an excellent lawyer. People called Lincoln "Honest Abe" because of his
personal integrity. In 1842, Lincoln married a woman named Mary Todd.
During the 1850s, Lincoln became strongly opposed the expansion of slavery into the
western parts of the United States. Lincoln held several famous debates against a
supporter of slavery named Stephen Douglas.
In 1860, Lincoln was a candidate in the election for President of the United States. During
this election, the issue of slavery and its expansion was very prominent. Lincoln won, but
soon after, several of the southern states decided to secede from the United States, and
form their own country. A few months later, fighting started between those southern
states and the federal government, which was supported by the northern states.
Lincoln managed the Civil War with skill and determination. Gradually the North began to
win the war. In 1863, Lincoln made the "Emancipation Proclamation," which freed the
slaves. Later that year, Lincoln gave his most famous speech, the Gettysburg Address.
The Civil War had brought terrible suffering to many Americans, and people were very

48 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
bitter after the war. But Lincoln wanted the country to become united again, and he urged
people to forgive. However, in April of 1865, only months after the war ended, Lincoln
was shot and killed by an assassin. Many people, even Lincoln's critics, mourned his
death.
In the generations that have passed since Lincoln's death, he has continued to be viewed
as a great President. Some historians have criticized Lincoln for not being more strongly
opposed to slavery, but others have defended him, saying that Lincoln's approach to the
issue was realistic and humane. But nearly all historians agree that Lincoln was an
honest and brave leader during the most difficult period in American history.

Article #55
Two Great Musicians : Mozart and Beethoven
Much of the music of eighteenth and nineteenth century Europe is still enjoyed by many
people. Two of the greatest musicians of that time were born only thirty-four years apart,
and actually knew each other for a short time. These great musicians were Mozart and
Beethoven.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Austria in the year 1756. As a child, Mozart was a
musical prodigy. He began composing music before his fifth birthday, and by the time he
reached his teenage years, Mozart had already written many symphonies and other
musical works.
As a young man, Mozart worked as a "concert-master" for the Archbishop of Salzburg, in
Austria. He also travelled to various European cities. When he was in his mid-twenties,
Mozart moved to the city of Vienna. Mozart had difficulty earning a living, but during this
time he wrote some excellent operas and string quartets. Many people did not yet
appreciate the greatness of Mozart's music.
In his early thirties, Mozart became the court musician for the Emperor of Austria, and
during the next few years Mozart continued to write many beautiful works of music.
Mozart died in 1791, but although his life was short, his productivity had been enormous.
The beauty, grace, and technical precision of his music is still greatly admired, and he is
considered one of the greatest musicians of all time.
When Mozart was in Vienna, he met a young musician named Ludwig van Beethoven.
Beethoven performed some music for Mozart, who was greatly impressed by the talent of
this young man. Beethoven had been born in Germany in 1770, and from an early age he
had displayed a great aptitude for music.
Beethoven moved permanently to Vienna in 1792. He studied music under some famous
composers, and became known for his outstanding skill in playing the piano. Beethoven
began to compose more of his own music, and these works became very popular. When
in his late twenties, Beethoven began to lose his hearing. He continued to compose
excellent music, but he became more withdrawn, and performed less frequently.
By the year 1817, Beethoven had become completely deaf, and he could no longer
perform music. However, his creative genius did not deteriorate. Instead, Beethoven
created many of his greatest works despite his deafness. It was Beethoven's influence
that began the "Romantic" era of music, which followed the "classical" era of the
nineteenth century. Beethoven died in 1827, but his music remains famous for its beauty
and originality. His greatest symphonies, such as the Fifth Symphony, are among the
world's best-known works of music.
Today, the works of Mozart and Beethoven are still popular among those who appreciate

49 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
great music. Music fans can look back with wonder at the musical creativity that
flourished in Vienna more than two centuries ago.

Article #56
Amelia Earhart
Amelia Earhart was one of the most famous airplane pilots of all time. She is famous for
the impressive travels that she made in her airplane, for the mystery surrounding her
death, and for showing that women could perform great feats of aviation.
Amelia Earhart was born in the American state of Kansas, in the year 1897. After
graduating from high school, Earhart studied to become a nurse. She worked as a
military nurse in Canada during World War One, treating injured soldiers. After the war,
she returned to the United States, and became a social worker. But in 1920 she saw
airplanes in a stunt-flying exhibition, and early the next year she took her first ride in an
airplane. It was then that Amelia Earhart decided to become a pilot.
Within a few months, Earhart saved her money and bought a small airplane. She flew
frequently, and improved her skills as a pilot. In 1928, she joined two men in a flight
across the Atlantic Ocean.
But Amelia Earhart's greatest exploits were still to come. In May 1932, she attempted to
become the first woman to fly "solo," or alone, across the Atlantic Ocean. She flew east
from the island of Newfoundland, and faced cold weather, high winds, and dense fog. But
she successfully crossed the ocean, and landed her airplane in a farmer's field in Ireland.
When news of her flight reached the United States, Amelia Earhart had become very
famous.
Later flights by Amelia Earhart were equally impressive. She became the first person to
fly from Hawaii to California, across 4000 kilometres of the Pacific Ocean. She also
became the first person to fly from Mexico City to the New York City area. But in 1937,
she planned her most ambitious flight: a journey around the world.
On June 1st, 1937, Amelia Earhart took off from Miami, Florida. She was accompanied by
her navigator, Fred Noonan. They flew east, making stops along the way. Within one
month, they had flown across three-quarters of the globe, reaching the Pacific island of
New Guinea. On July 2nd, Earhart and Noonan took off from New Guinea, flying toward
Howland Island. This very small island was over 4000 kilometres from New Guinea, and
was very difficult to find in the middle of the vast ocean.
During this flight, Earhart and Noonan were in radio contact with some ships from the
U.S. Navy. However, bad weather made it impossible to see the stars at night, so
navigation was very difficult, and the plane became lost. Earhart and Noonan never
arrived at Howland Island. The U.S. Navy undertook a massive search, but they never
found the lost airplane. Earhart and Noonan had been lost at sea.
Amelia Earhart's death was a great tragedy, but she had lived an exciting life that was full
of achievements. She had helped to show that very long flights could be made, and that
women could perform feats of flying that were equal to those of men. Even today, many
people are inspired by the courage and endurance of Amelia Earhart.

Article #57
Life in Academia
A person like me, who teaches and conducts research at an academic institution, is

50 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
called "academic." The academic institution may be a form of a university, a college or
another post-secondary institution. I have been working in universities for almost eleven
years. While enjoying my life in academia, we "academics" also have a lot of stress and
often go through a large amount of stress and frustration.
Firstly, we have pressure from the university we are working at to become effective
teachers. As the environment (in terms of the society and the marketplace) has become
more dynamic and competitive, we, as teachers, must provide students with necessary
skills and knowledge so they can become successful in their society. It requires a lot of
preparation, updating of material, self-learning, and continuous improvement in teaching.
For these reasons, teaching and learning should complement each other.
Secondly, we have pressure from both our university and our academic peers to become
active and effective researchers. What we teach to our students in class is no doubt
closely related to what we have learned or discovered from our research activities.
Thirdly, we have pressure from the university and the community to become good
corporate citizens through active participation in various university committees and/or
the community at large. A university and the community it belongs to must work closely
together to identify common interests and to conduct projects that could benefit both
parties.
Even with a high degree of the aforementioned pressures, I love my job as a teacher,
scholar, and citizen. There is a high level of freedom and flexibility. Academia is a place
to meet new people, to create new ideas, and for everyone in that community to learn. It
is a place where both teaching and learning always take place.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #58
Education Systems in Canada
In Canada each province is responsible for its own education systems. In general, there
are three levels of education systems in Canada: (i) Kindergarten to Grade 8; (ii) Grade 9
to Grade 12; and (iii) Post-Secondary education. Kindergarten may further be divided into
Junior and Senior Kindergarten for four and five years old children, respectively.
Grade 9 to 12 students are enrolled in a secondary school system, which is similar to a
high school system in the U.S.A. Some cities and towns may have a junior high school
system, which accommodates children from Grade 7 to Grade 9. In the Province of
Ontario there is Grade 13, which is a required step for all students who want to attend a
degree-granting university. This feature has been unique for Ontario, but the Province
has decided to abolish it in order to be consistent with other provinces' secondary
education systems. By Year 2003, when Grade 13 is completely abandoned, the number
of students entering a university or college is expected to be almost double (called
"double cohort").
Post-secondary education system in Canada includes universities, community colleges,
university colleges, and other private institutions providing post-secondary education,
such as skill training and continuing education. A university is a standing-alone, degree-
granting institution that offers certificates, diplomas, and Bachelor/Master/Ph.D. degrees.
There are about 50 universities throughout the country, most of which are publicly
funded institutions. Some of the most recognized universities include the University of
Toronto, McGill University, the University of British Columbia, and Queen's University.
A community college offers a variety of programs for students who want to learn

51 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
technical skills, skills that they can apply to the real world quickly. These programs are
usually one or two years in length emphasizing hand-on experience in classroom setting.
It grants certificates and diplomas and offers a variety of training courses for people who
want to upgrade themselves with the current markets and new technologies.
A university college, as the name implies, is somewhat in between a community college
and a university. This type of institution is common in British Columbia, the most
western province in Canada. It grants certificates and diplomas by itself. However, it is
not able to grant university degrees alone, although it often offers all the courses
required for a university degree. The curriculum for a degree program is usually
designed in conjunction with a university, which actually grants degrees to the university
college students.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #59
Business Education
What is business? A business includes all the activities involved to create and sell a
product or service. The most important functional areas of business include: accounting,
finance, marketing, production/operations, and human resources management.
Accounting is a field of business that records and reports the flow of funds through a
firm on a historical basis and produces important financial statements such as balance
sheets and income statements. It also produces forecasts of future conditions such as
projected financial statements and financial budgets, and evaluates the firm's financial
performance against the forecasts.
The finance area of business supports a firm in decisions concerning the financing of the
firm's business and the allocation and control of financial resources within the firm.
Major activities of finance include cash and investment management, capital budgeting,
financial forecasting, and financial planning. The cash and investment management
activities forecast and manage the firm's cash position and short-term and other
securities. The capital budgeting activity involves evaluating the profitability and risk of
proposed capital expenditures. The financial planning process evaluates the present and
projected financial performance of the firm and projects the firm's future financial needs.
The marketing function of business is concerned with the planning, promotion, sale, and
distribution of existing products or services in existing markets, and the development of
new products and new markets in order to better serve existing and potential customers
with quality products and services. It is also responsible for customer relationship
management, product planning, pricing, advertising, after-sale service, and market
research and forecasting.
The production/operations function focuses on the management of all activities
concerned with the planning and control of the processes producing goods or services.
These activities include purchasing of raw material and parts, product design, inventory,
manufacturing processes, facilities location and layout, quality control, and such other
logistics as distribution and transportation.
The human resource management function involves the recruitment, placement,
evaluation, compensation, and development of a firm's employees. With the main goal of
the effective and efficient use of a firm's human capital, the human resources
management function supports planning to meet the personnel needs of the business,
development of employees to their full potential, and control of all personnel policies and
programs.

52 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
While each of the aforementioned functional areas within a firm used to operate
somewhat independently with its own objectives and resources, information and other
computer technologies have integrated all business functions within the firm and created
something called "an Internet worked e-business enterprise."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #60
Strategic Uses of Information Technology
What is information technology? How can information technology be used in an
organization to improve its efficiency? How much investment should an organization
make in information technology? What are the business benefits and opportunities an
organization may achieve from using information technology? These are some of the
most important questions many organizations ask themselves before investing their
capitals in information technology.
In an academic term, information technology is defined as hardware, software,
telecommunications, database management, and other information processing
technologies used in computer-based information systems. There are many ways that
organizations may view and use information technology. However, in today's competitive
business environment technology is no longer an afterthought in forming business
strategy, but it is the actual cause and driver. In other words, for a firm to maintain or
improve its business competitiveness it must use information technology to achieve
strategic advantage.
Information technology can help a company substantially reduce the cost of business
processes and lower the costs of customers or suppliers.
Information technology can help a company differentiate its products and services from
others.
Using information technology, a firm can create new products and services or make
radical changes to business processes.
A firm can use information technology to manage regional and global business
expansion or to diversify and integrate into other products and services.
A firm can use information technology to create virtual organizations of business
partners or to develop alliances with customers, suppliers, and other business partners.
Information technology can dramatically improve the efficiency of business processes
and the quality of products and services.
Using information technology, a firm can build a strategic information base of all the
information collected.
Some experts argue that use of information technology has become a strategic necessity
rather than a strategic advantage, because most competitive advantages don't last more
than a few years. Whether the statement is true or not, most companies may not want to
wait too long before investing in information technology because it would be tough to
catch up later once you get behind your competitors, especially when everyone is
playing with newer, better technology.

Article #61
E-Commerce
Electronic commerce (or simply e-commerce) is more than just buying and selling
products or services online. It encompasses the entire online process of developing,

53 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
marketing, selling, delivering, servicing, and paying for products and services. E-
commerce systems rely on the resources of the Internet and other computer networks to
support every step of the process. Through an e-commerce system, customers can order
and make payment for the products or services they purchase online and receive support
at the company's websites through the Internet. It also allows customers and suppliers to
participate in product development via Internet newsgroups and E-mail exchanges. There
are three basic types of e-commerce applications: business-to-business (B2B), business-
to-consumer (B2C), and consumer-to-consumer (C2C).
Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce is the online automation of purchase and sale
transactions from business to business. Many companies use secure Internet or
extranets for their business customers and suppliers to access to their websites while
some may rely on electronic data interchange (EDI) systems. Cisco Systems, a leading
manufacturer of computer networking equipment, makes about 40 percent of its sales
online. These activities include order taking, credit check, production scheduling and
technical support to their customers. General Electric and the United Parcel Service
(UPS) are a few of many other firms that offer B2B e-commerce sites.
Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce creates electronic marketplaces where
businesses promote and sell products and services directly to consumers. In this form of
electronic commerce, which has grown into a multibillion dollar market, businesses can
bypass intermediaries such as distributors or retail outlets. Companies like Amazon.com
and Dell Corporation offer e-commerce websites that provide virtual storefronts and
multimedia catalogs, interactive order processing, secure electronic payment systems,
and online customer support.
Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce is an important alternative for business-to-
business or business-to-consumer e-commerce. In this form of e-commerce, consumers
can buy and sell products and services with each other in an auction process at an
auction website. Through an online auction site like e-Bay, one of the most successful
C2C e-commerce models, consumers or businesses can participate in or sponsor
consumer or business auctions. Other forms of consumer-to-consumer e-commerce
include personal advertising of products or services by consumers at electronic
newspaper sites, consumer e-commerce portals, or personal websites.

The First Five Years of My Life in Canada
I left Korea 25 years ago for Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I was 17 years old at that time.
Now everyone knows how old I am. As any immigrant who left his or her own country for
a new place looking for a better life, I believe the first five years of my living in Canada
were the most challenging ones.
It did not take long time for me to realize that I would have to face one of the biggest
challenges in my life: the language problem. Although I had learned English in high
schools for almost for five years before coming to Canada, I did not find it useful in day-
to-day living at this new place. My frustrations, stemming from lack of my English
conversation skills, included ordering food at a fast-food restaurant, phone conversation,
and conversations with neighbors.
The most frustrating moment was my inability to explain to other people when I was
accused of something I did not do. Knowing that I was not able to defend myself properly
due to lack of conversation skills, a few people often took advantage of me for their own

benefits.
However, throughout the years I met a lot of good people who gave me strength and
encouragement. Among those people in my heart I still remember Mrs. Overholts. Mrs.
Overholts was working in the Counsellor's Office at the high school I attended for two
years, and she gave me a lot of valued advice and directions in regards to my academic
life, as well as my personal one.
My dear friends in my high school also helped me not only to survive in the new country
but also taught me the new cultures and systems. Some of them went to the same
university as I did, while others went to different institutions. I am still in contact with
many of them, but wherever they are I believe they are making a positive contribution to
the society.
I owe the most to my father; my mother, who passed away seven years ago; and my
brothers. We were neither rich nor poor, but we stuck together all the time. My parents
taught me love, care, and kindness through their actions, not just their words. It was
from my family that I got strength when I was weak. It was my family who listened to me
when I needed to talk. It was my family who really was happy for me when I told them
good news.
The first five years of my life in Canada surely was one of the most difficult times in my
life. I believe, however, that it was also an important time period in my life for me to
become a more mature and independent human being. I thank all of those who played a
role in some way to help me out during the transition period of my life.

Great Lakes
The Great Lakes are a group of five large freshwater lakes in North America that are
interconnected by natural and artificial channels. They are (from east to west): Lake
Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, and Lake Superior. Most of them, except
Lake Michigan, which lies entirely within the United States, form part of the border
between the United States and Canada.
The Great Lakes are bordered by the Canadian province of Ontario and by eight U.S.
states including (from west to east) Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York. Large cities like Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and
Toronto lie on the shores of the Great Lakes system. The Great Lakes system, with a
combined surface area of 244,100 sq km, holds about 20 percent of the world's fresh
surface water.
Lake elevations decrease to the east and south. Lake Superior, the largest lake at 82,100
sq km, is also the largest freshwater lake in the world. Its outlet is the Saint Mary's River,
which enters Lake Huron after falling about 7 metres over a series of rapids. Lake Huron
and Lake Michigan lie at the same elevation. Water flows from Lake Michigan to Lake
Huron. Lake Michigan is deeper than Lake Huron, but the latter is larger in area, at 59,600
sq km.
Lake Huron drains into the Saint Clair River, which falls about 3 metres between Lake
Huron and the small, shallow basin of Lake Saint Clair. Lake Saint Clair is connected to
Lake Erie by the Detroit River. At its northeast end, Lake Erie empties into the Niagara
River, which drops 99 metres as it flows north to Lake Ontario, which is the smallest of
the Great Lakes at 19,010 sq km. Lake Ontario is linked with the Atlantic Ocean via the St.
Lawrence River.

55 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
The Great Lakes, interconnected by rivers, straits, and canals, are a natural resource of
tremendous significance in North America; they serve as the focus of the industrial
heartland of the continent and together form one of the world's busiest shipping arteries.
The lakes also form an important recreational resource with about 17,000 km of shoreline,
rich sport fisheries, and numerous beaches and marinas.

Article #64
Canadian Rocky Mountains
Some of the best-known mountain scenery on Earth is concentrated in a set of seven
parks in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. There are four national parks in the Canadian
Rockies - Banff, Jasper, Yoho and Kootenay, and three British Columbia provincial parks
- Mount Robson, Mount Assiniboine and Hamber. The seven preserves located along the
Alberta-British Columbia border attract more than nine million people annually.
Banff National Park became Canada's first national park in 1885, and the birthplace of
Canada's national park system. It is home to a variety of distinctive natural features and
cultural and historical sites. Rugged mountains, glaciers, icefields, alpine meadows,
beautiful blue cold-water lakes, mineral hot springs, deep canyons and hoodoos
compose the natural landscape and habitat for a great variety of mammals such as elk,
bighorn sheep, black and grizzly bear, and caribou.
Jasper National Park is the largest and most northerly of the Canadian Rocky Mountain
Parks. The park is less commercialized than Banff, so it can still keep many natural
beauties and scenery. Its scenery includes deeply gouged Maligne Canyon, picturesque
Maligne Lake, the thunder of Sunwapta Falls, the serene beauty of glacier-covered Mount
Edith Cavell, and Miette Hot Springs.
As one of 39 national parks in Canada, Kootenay National Park represents the south-
western slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. From glacier-clad peaks to semi-arid
grasslands, where even cactus grows, Kootenay is rich in variety and is one of the
largest protected areas in the world.
Yoho National Park, representing the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains region,
holds the secrets of ancient ocean life, the power of ice and water, and unique plant and
animal communities that continue to evolve today. Awe and wonder is a natural response
for this place of rock walls, spectacular waterfalls and soaring peaks. The Burgess Shale
contains one of the world's most significant finds of soft-bodied, Middle Cambrian-age
marine fossils, with about 150 species, including some bearing no resemblance to known
animals.
These four Canadian National Parks account for 14,300 square miles. The four National
Parks along with the three British Columbia provincial parks form the UNESCO Rocky
Mountain Parks World Heritage Site-one of the largest protected areas in the world.

For the Record
What is the world's tallest mountain and highest elevation? Of course, Mt. Everest, on the
border of Nepal and Tibet, China, is the world's tallest mountain and highest elevation
with a peak at 29,035 feet (or 8850 m). The National Geographic Society revised the
height of Mt. Everest in 1999 from 29,028 feet (or 8848 m) due to new GPS calculations.
What is the world's tallest mountain from base to peak? Mauna Kea in Hawaii is the one.

56 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
Its base is on the sea floor, and it rises 33,480 feet (or 10,314 meters) in total, reaching
13,796 feet (or 4205 m) above sea level.
In reference to its towering height of 20,320 feet above sea level, Mt. McKinley in Alaska
is the tallest mountain in North America. It has been named "The Roof of North America"
or "The Chimney of North America."
Located about 55 kilometers drive from Amman, Jordan the Dead Sea in the Middle East
region is the lowest point on Earth. The sunset touching distant hills with ribbons of fire
across the waters of the Dead Sea brings a sense of unreality to culminate a day's visit to
the lowest point on earth, some 1,320 feet (or 400 meters) below sea level. En route a
stone marker indicates "Sea Level," but the Dead Sea itself is not reached before
descending another 400 meters below this sign. As the name suggests, the sea is devoid
of life due to an extremely high content of salts and minerals. But it is these natural
elements which give the waters their curative powers, recognized since the days of
Herod the Great, more than 2,000 years ago. They also provide the raw materials for the
renowned Jordanian Dead Sea Bath Salts and cosmetic products which are marketed
worldwide.
Badwater basin, the floor of Death Valley National Park in California, is the lowest point in
the western hemisphere with 282 feet (or 85 meters) below sea level. Death Valley
National Park, established in 1933, has more than 3.3 million acres of spectacular desert
scenery, interesting and rare desert wildlife, complex geology, undisturbed wilderness,
and sites of historical and cultural interest.

Canadian Universities
There are about fifty standing-alone, 4-year degree-granting universities in Canada.
Unlike the higher education system in the United States, most of the universities in
Canada are publicly funded institutions although there are a few private institutions.
These public universities are funded and regulated by the province to which they belong.
In British Colombia there are four publicly funded universities: University of British
Columbia, Simon Fraser University, University of Victoria, and University of Northern
British Columbia; and one private university: Trinity Western University.
In Alberta the three publicly funded universities are University of Alberta, University of
Calgary, and University of Lethbridge.
In Saskatchewan the two publicly funded universities are University of Saskatchewan
and University of Regina.
Moving into Manitoba, there are three publicly funded universities in the province. They
are University of Manitoba, University of Winnipeg, and Brandon University.
Ontario is not only the most populated province in Canada but also has the largest
number of universities. It has 17 publicly funded universities. They are (from west to east
and south to north): University of Windsor, University of Western Ontario, University of
Guelph, University of Waterloo, Wilfred Laurier University, McMaster University, Brock
University, York University, University of Toronto, Ryerson University, Trent University,
Queen's University, University of Ottawa, Carleton University, Laurentian University,
Nipissing University, and Lakehead University.
The Province of Quebec has seven publicly funded universities with many of them
having several branch campuses throughout the province. They are University of
Montreal, University of Quebec, Laval University, Concordia University, McGill University,

57 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
University of Sherbrooke, and Bishop's University. While French is the official language
of instruction at most of these institutions, English is the official one at both Concordia
University and McGill University.
Canada's Atlantic Provinces have the rest of the fifty universities in Canada. They are
University of New Brunswick and University of Moncton in the Province of New
Brunswick; Acadia University, Dalhousie University, Mount Allison University, Mount
Saint Vincent University, Saint Mary's University, and Nova Scotia Agricultural College in
the Province of Nova Scotia; University of Prince Edward Island in the Province of Prince
Edward Island; and University of Newfoundland in the Province of Newfoundland and
Labrador.

Article #67
Banff National Park
Banff National Park is Canada's oldest and most famous national park. It was founded in
1885 after the discovery of the Cave and Basin Hot Springs. From humble beginnings as
a 26 square kilometre hot springs reserve, Banff National Park now consists of 6,641
square kilometres of unparalleled mountain scenery nestled in the heart of the
magnificent Canadian Rockies. Each year, millions of visitors come to Banff to marvel at
the emerald waters of Lake Louise, walk amongst the flower-filled heavens at Sunshine
Meadows, and drive beneath the towering jagged peaks lining the Ice fields Parkway
between Banff and Jasper.
Ten thousand years ago, natives camped on the shores of the Vermilion Lakes beneath
the windswept peak of Mount Rundle. They were the only people here to enjoy the
mountain landscape, the beautiful sunrises and the hot springs. Nearly ten millennia later,
a struggling nation forged a crazy dream of connecting itself from sea to sea with steel
rails, and from this railway venture was born Canada's most famous park, Banff National
Park.
Banff National Park contains some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in the
world. Snow-capped peaks, glistening glaciers, ice fields, alpine meadows, blue cold
crystal clear lakes, raging rivers, mineral hot springs, deep canyons, hoodoos and
sweeping vistas are just one part of the allure of Banff National Park. The park is also the
home of some of North America's wildest creatures, including black and grizzly bears,
caribou and wolves.
Banff and Lake Louis are two major towns in Banff National Park. As the largest town in
the park, Banff is "Canada's Highest Town" at 1384 m (4540 ft) above sea level. Lake
Louise, with its blue-green water set against the stark backdrop of Victoria Glacier, is the
highest permanent settlement in Canada at 1,536m (5,039 feet) above the sea level and
probably the most beloved and most photographed scene in the Canadian Rockies.
In Banff National Park, driving through the Bow Valley Parkway, one of the world's most
scenic highways, is a good opportunity to see animals, particularly deer, bears and
moose. Banff National Park is part of the UNESCO Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage
Site.

Article #68
Sport Canada
Sport Canada is the name of Canada's federal government program to help support

58 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
athletes. The purpose of Sport Canada is to develop and encourage sport, health, and
exercise programs for all Canadians. However, Sport Canada's main emphasis is on
high-performance athletes training for major international athletic competitions, such as
the Olympic Games.
Sport Canada was created in the 1970s as a response to the perceived need to help
athletes train and compete in international sport. Before the 1970s, athletes wishing to
train and compete in sport had to support themselves financially. Athletes were either
independently wealthy, or were supported by family or friends. Unfortunately, many high-
caliber athletes without such financial support simply could not afford to train and
compete in international competition.
Also, before the early 1970s almost all international sports events were amateur. Amateur
rules meant those receiving funds from government programs or corporations were
breaking the rules of sport. Athletes receiving money were disqualified from competition.
As a result, the amateur rules generally limited training and competition to those athletes
who came from wealthier families. Less fortunate athletes, many of whom likely would
have performed well for Canada in international competitions, simply could not afford to
do so.
Sport Canada has been a role model for many government-run sport programs around
the world. With its central administrative offices in Canada's capital of Ottawa, Sport
Canada efficiently provides administrative, coaching, and financial help for athletes
across the country. Athletes can concentrate their efforts full-time on training and
competition. As a result, Canada's share of the medal totals in the Olympic Games has
risen since the 1970s.
Recently, Sport Canada's programs have been criticized by some who feel that the
program does not provide enough money for athletes. While it does provide financial
assistance to athletes, the amount paid is well below Canada's minimum wage. Critics
point out that athletes work full-time and perform an important function for the Canadian
government and people. As a result of this criticism, the Canadian government has
provided more money for athletes. However, the amount is still below the minimum wage
level. As a result, the amount paid to athletes is likely to rise in the future.
As long as it effectively manages problems such as funding, Sport Canada will continue
to provide the Canadian public with international-caliber athletes who compete with the
very best in the world.

Article #69
The National Hockey League
The National Hockey League (or NHL) is the largest and most successful North American
professional hockey league. The NHL provides Canadians and Americans with the
highest caliber and most entertaining hockey on the continent.
The NHL was created in 1917 by a group of Canadian and American businessmen. Their
two central goals were to create a league that provided the most entertaining hockey in
North America and generated revenues and profits. This was a somewhat new idea at the
time. While there were some for-profit leagues in existence, most were amateur. This
meant that players, coaches, and owners of teams were not allowed to make money from
playing the game of hockey.
It took several decades for the NHL to become the most dominant league. In the early
days, a few professional or commercial leagues competed with the NHL for the public's

59 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
entertainment dollar. Leagues competed vigorously for the best players in order to be
successful and attract spectators and fans. While this was beneficial to players because
they could command higher salaries, it was bad for business because owners' expenses
skyrocketed. As a result, many teams and leagues went bankrupt.
By the 1930s, however, the NHL remained as the only major professional league in North
America. This effectively kept players' salaries down and reduced expenses. The NHL's
team owners realized that in order for the league to be a successful commercial business,
they would have to stop competing against each other off the ice. This was best
accomplished by ensuring that only one major league existed, so that competition was
reduced. To this day, the same business model is followed, and the NHL is still the only
major professional hockey league in North America.
For several decades in the mid-twentieth century, the NHL owners were extremely
successful financially. They generated very high profits because, having a monopoly on
in the hockey market, they could limit the sale and trade of players. When players signed
on to a team, they generally did so for life, and at the pay rate determined by the owner.
Players were forced to accept these conditions because there were no other leagues in
existence.
This all changed in the 1970s when players organized to form a players' union. Through
the collective bargaining process, players gradually fought owners for higher pay and
greater rights. Today, many players are very wealthy for this reason. If it was not for the
players' union, it is likely they would still be working in similar conditions to those during
the early days of the NHL: low pay and little freedom to move from team to team.
With NHL owners and players cooperating, the NHL continues to be the most successful
and entertaining hockey league in North America. Teams across Canada and the United
States compete for the prized Stanley Cup, the most sought-after trophy in North
American hockey.

Article #70
Drug Use in Sport
Athletes using drugs to enhance performance has become one of the greatest problems
facing elite international sport. Major sports organizations, such as the International
Olympic Committee, are putting a lot of time, effort, and money into the detection of
drugs. The race between athletes using drugs and detection agencies seems to be just
as fierce as sport competition itself.
Athletes have been using drugs or other stimulants to enhance performance for
centuries. Even athletes in the ancient Olympic Games in Greece used various
stimulants to enhance performance. However, since the 1950s the degree of drug use
has risen to a level never before seen in human athletic history.
Drug testing began in the Olympic Games in the 1960s. One of the first sports to
encounter drug use was cycling. During the 1960 Summer Olympic Games in Rome, Italy,
a cyclist died from amphetamine use. In 1967, another cyclist died in the Tour de France
cycling race. Around the same period, body-builders in the United States were
experimenting with newly developed synthetic steroids that built muscle mass. As a
result, the International Olympic Committee started testing for steroids during the 1976
Olympic Games in Montreal, Canada.
Probably the most famous case of an athlete using drugs was Canadian sprinter Ben
Johnson. After winning the 100-metre sprint in the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in

60 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
Seoul, South Korea, Johnson's drug test was found to be positive. Johnson took a
synthetic steroid to build muscle mass and enhance power. Eventually, Johnson was
stripped of his gold medal.
In the aftermath of Johnson's positive drug test, the Canadian government conducted a
federal inquiry into drug use in Canadian sport. The government inquiry was the largest
one to have been conducted in any country up to that point in time. The results of the
inquiry found that drug use among Canadian athletes was very common. The inquiry
stated that there were problems beyond just individual athletes, such as Johnson, taking
drugs to enhance performance. Indeed, it was stated that there was a moral crisis
throughout sport.
Today, the race between drug detection agencies and athletes who use drugs continues.
In January 2000, the International Olympic Committee created a new agency to detect
drug use: the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). WADA has provided increased
resources for drug detection, especially in Olympic sports. Hopefully, WADA will be able
to keep pace with the current moral crisis in sport.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #71
Participation
"ParticipAction" was the name of the Canadian government program designed to
encourage Canadians to get and stay physically fit. Created in 1971 by the federal
government, ParticipAction was successful in encouraging Canadians to be active and to
stay healthy.
ParticipAction was created by the Canadian Liberal government of Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau. Trudeau believed that sport and recreation should play an important role in the
lives of Canadian citizens. His government took two steps towards the accomplishment
of this goal. First, a government agency was created to provide funds for high
performance athletes, such as those training and competing in the Olympic Games. A
second agency was created to encourage participation and physical activity in the
general Canadian population. It was out of this second agency that ParticipAction was
born.
ParticipAction became famous in the 1970s because of a series of television
commercials. In these commercials, a young Canadian in his 20's was seen being out-
run by a 60-year old Swedish man. The message was that Canadians had become lazy
and inactive. This was probably true of Canadians at the time. Physical fitness was not
highly encouraged in schools, especially for women. Also, the government played little
role in encouraging physical activity before ParticipAction.
The result of ParticipAction was impressive. Canadians became more active in the years
following the program's inception. Also, fitness and activity were encouraged through
physical education programs. ParticipAction was seen as a positive program because it
got Canadians active while reducing health care costs caused by inactivity and poor
physical conditioning.
Recently, ParticipAction was terminated by the federal government because of a lack of
funding. Many people thought this was a shame given the positive messages the
program gave to otherwise inactive Canadians. Despite the program's termination,
ParticipAction has made a long-lasting impression on Canadians. Hopefully, its positive
example of physical fitness for Canadians will continue in the future.

Article #72
The Olympic Games
The modern Olympic Games began in the late-nineteenth century as a revival of the
ancient Greek Olympics. Now just over one hundred years old, the modern Olympic
movement is the biggest and most important sports movement in the world. In fact, many
people believe the Olympic Games to be the most important cultural event of any kind in
the world.
The modern Olympic Games were the brainchild of Frenchman Baron Pierre de
Coubertin. De Coubertin's dream for an international sports event and cultural movement
became a reality in 1894 at the International Athletic Congress in Paris. After the Games
were constituted in 1894, the first Olympic Games was held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, in
recognition of the ancient Greek Olympic Games.
The original purpose of the Olympic Games in de Coubertin's mind was to celebrate and
strengthen the physical, mental, and cultural qualities of humanity. The Games would
blend sport with culture, tradition, and education. The philosophy of Olympism is based
on the joy of physical and mental effort and the respect for universal ethical principles.
De Coubertin envisioned creating a more noble and sympathetic humanity through the
Olympic movement.
The sports events themselves de Coubertin modeled after the English public school
sport system. He saw in upper-class English boys' sport the qualities of camaraderie,
nobility, and honesty. Most importantly, however, was adherence to the rules of sport, in
particular the rule that stated sport ought to be amateur in nature. De Coubertin believed
participants should never participate in sport for the purpose of making money. To do so
would contradict the underlying philosophy of sport. Breaking the amateur rule in de
Coubertin's time was as serious a violation as taking drugs to enhance performance is in
today's world of sport.
Over time, the Olympics grew to be the largest international festival of any kind. Today,
debates exist as to the degree to which the modern Games adhere to de Coubertin's
original intent. On the one hand, Olympic sport is truly international in nature, as de
Coubertin would have wanted it. On the other hand, it is doubtful that de Coubertin would
have admired the existence of politics, commercialism, and drug use in sport. The
Olympics have become truly international, but perhaps at a price.
There is little question that the Olympic Games hold out the possibility for fulfilling de
Coubertin's original goal of sport contributing to a better, more peaceful, and
understanding world.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #73
Sport in Canada
There is a long and rich history of sport participation in Canada. Many of the sports and
games Canadians currently play can be traced back to the early days of Canadian history.
In the nineteenth century, sport and games in Canada were not highly organized. Few
people had the time or money for playing games. The harsher aspects of everyday life
took precedence. However, around the turn of the century, several amateur sport
organizations emerged. These groups attempted to organize sports competitions, set
rules, and develop teams and leagues. As a result, organized competitions quickly grew
in number around this period in time, especially in the 50-year period between 1870 and

62 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
1920.
Some of the earliest organized sports in Canada were rifle shooting, rowing, track and
field, rugby football, skating, cricket, and golf, among others. Many of these sports were
imports of sporting traditions from Great Britain. This made sense given that many of the
leaders of early amateur sports organizations were recent British immigrants to Canada.
An example of early Canadian sport can be seen in the sport of rowing. Imported from
the rowing traditions in England, rowing was one of the most famous sports in early
Canadian history. Although relatively few Canadians actually rowed themselves, many
participated as spectators. Rowing races between Canadian oarsmen and between
Canadians and international competitors were famous events. Also, gambling or betting
on the outcome of races attracted many spectators.
The most famous Canadian athlete of the times was Ned Hanlan (1855-1908). An oarsman,
Hanlan remains to this day one of the most famous athletes in Canadian history. In fact,
during his life he was famous throughout the world. A Canadian and world champion
several times over, Hanlan was a fierce competitor. However, Hanlan was also famous for
his appeal to spectators. He made a regular practice of gaining a seemingly
insurmountable lead over his rival and then stopping to wave at the crowds on the
shoreline. He would even slow down during a race, allowing his competition to catch up
to him, only to take the win at the last moment. These exploits made Hanlan one of the
first showmen in sport; he recognized the importance of the entertainment value of sport.
Sport in Canada has developed rapidly since Hanlan's time. Today, Canada has a
complex system of amateur sports organizations and professional leagues. In addition,
in the 1960s the federal government of Canada became directly involved in the pursuit of
healthy lifestyles and sporting traditions of Canadians. Today, the government provides
funds for elite amateur athletes preparing for World Championships and the Olympic
Games. The athletic role models produced by these government programs are crucial to
Canadians in general.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #74
Professional Sport in Canada
Canada is a relatively young country, existing as a separate national and political entity
only since 1867. As a result, its sporting traditions are relatively young as well. Most of
the professional teams and leagues in Canada developed only in the last 30 years or so.
However, athletes playing their respective sports for money dates back to the late-
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Canada has six National Hockey League (NHL) teams, eight Canadian Football League
(CFL) clubs, two Major League Baseball (MLB) clubs, and one National Basketball
Association (NBA) team. There are also smaller professional soccer and lacrosse
leagues in Canada. It is estimated that professional sports and leagues throughout the
country contribute over $600 million in value to the country's economy, and account for
over 23,000 jobs.
Of the professional sports, hockey has the longest history and the greatest cultural
influence on Canadians. The NHL has been in existence since 1917; however, organized
professional and amateur leagues existed in Canada long before then. Many small-town
teams competed for local or provincial championships, and had a strong influence on
those Canadians who had little access to, or knowledge of, big-city teams in Toronto or
Montreal. In fact, it was not until NHL games were broadcast on the Canadian national

63 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
radio "Hockey Night in Canada" radio broadcasts that many Canadians had experienced
an NHL game. Indeed, despite the fact that the NHL was considered Canada's most
prestigious league, it was not until the advent of television in the 1950s that most
Canadians had even seen an NHL game.
Today, all professional sport in Canada is in one way or another affected by the more
powerful American leagues. In the sports of baseball and basketball, Canada has no
professional leagues of its own. Instead, Canadian teams play in the American-
dominated leagues. These leagues require a large concentrated audience in order to
generate revenues for the team and, in turn, the league in general. As a result, the major
team franchises exist in the large urban centres: Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Even
between those cities, the teams are not evenly spread. Probably the most famous teams
in the American-dominated leagues are both Toronto teams: the "Blue Jays" in Major
League Baseball and the "Raptors" in the National Basketball Association.
Many Canadians worry that the American dominance of professional sport is a threat to
Canadian independence. As an important component of national culture, sport reflects
and reinforces the norms and values of Canada. However, the most sought-after and
visible teams in Canada are ones in American-dominated leagues. Even the National
Hockey League-once considered a secure Canadian sports icon-has its corporate offices
in New York. Debates about the threat of American-dominated professional sport to
Canadian sovereignty will undoubtedly continue in the future.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #75
Ned Hanlan
Edward (Ned) Hanlan (1855-1908) was one of the most important athletes in Canadian
history. Hanlan, an oarsman, helped shape the direction of Canadian sport in its early,
formative years. His combination of athletic success and popularity with rowing
spectators helped promote the cause of rowing and professional sport.
In the late-nineteenth century, rowing was one of the, if not the, most popular sports in
Canada. The sport received as much if not more press coverage and general public
interest than any other sport. In addition, the sport's long history in Canada, Great Britain,
Australia, and the United States developed into well-organized national and international
championships, including one of the first regularly held World Championships in any
sport. In fact, Hanlan was a regular winner of World Championship titles.
Part of the popularity of rowing involved gambling and lucrative prizes. Spectators
regularly bet on single sculling, in much the same way they do on horse racing today.
Hanlan quickly rose to fame in the late-nineteenth century through a combination of
careful financial planning of his athletic career and his mastery of the sport. Perhaps his
most ingenious invention was the now-common "sliding seat." By fixing wheels onto a
wooden seat, Hanlan gained an advantage over his competitors, who slid back and forth
in the boat on grease. The extra use of his legs translated into greater boat speed for
Hanlan.
Hanlan was also note-worthy for his methods of gaining popularity with fans.
Recognizing the importance of the entertainment value of sport, Hanlan would regularly
wave to the crowds and perform rowing "tricks" such as removing his hands from the
oars in the middle of the race. He was even known to fake an injury in the middle of a
race, only to recover just in time to win the race. Of course, the additional purpose of this
strategy was to raise gambling odds, thus making himself and his financial handlers

64 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
wealthier from his victories.
In the 1870s and 1880s, Hanlan won and then successfully defended his World
Championship title seven times. He also competed in commercial exhibitions and rowing
tours around the world. After his competitive career ended, Hanlan went on to coach
younger oarsmen in two North American universities: Toronto and Columbia. So famous
was Hanlan that one major newspaper in Canada claimed he was the single greatest
agent for attracting new immigrants to the young country. Today, a bronze statue stands
in Toronto in honour of his success, and an island just off the shores of the city of
Toronto is named after Hanlan.

Rowing
The sport of rowing is one of the oldest organized sports in the Western world. The
modern version of the sport was developed mainly in England in the nineteenth century,
especially in the public school system. However, boat races somewhat similar to the
modern sport took place in ancient Greece during the ancient version of the Olympics.
In the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, rowing gained much popularity. The
sport was particularly famous in countries with a history of immigration from Great
Britain: Canada, Australia, and the U.S.A. Most of the main colonial countries had
national championships, and a world championship was regularly held. The sport
developed either in private clubs or in elite educational institutions. In 1852, a race
between Yale and Harvard universities in the U.S. was the first organized athletic
competition of any kind.
The turn of the century saw the sport's ascendancy to one of the largest spectator sports.
Many regularly held races depended on betting or gambling to attract spectators. The
biggest international matches attracted thousands of spectators, and much money was
wagered. Canadian Ned Hanlan was perhaps the greatest of the early rowing champions.
In the late nineteenth century he dominated international rowing races. Hanlan also
combined his rowing skill and prowess with his own unique brand of showmanship to
attract spectators. Hanlan is also known for having invented the "sliding seat." His
wooden seat set on wheels greatly increased his efficiency and speed and gave him a
distinct advantage over competitors. Before Hanlan's time, rowers would wipe grease on
a wooden platform in the boat and slide over the grease. The older technique was less
reliable and did not allow as much leg drive as Hanlan's newly invented seat.
As the twentieth-century unfolded, rowing lost some of its earlier public support and
distinction. In North America, as professional sports attracted the attention of spectators
and television viewers, other amateur sporting traditions, such as rowing, lost support.
Today, rowing maintains a strong tradition under the administration of the world
governing body for the sport. However, the yearly world championship does not typically
receive the attention of other major sports events, such as track and field. The highlight
of rowing competition is undoubtedly the Olympic Games. However, older traditional
races, such as the English Henley and the yearly Oxford-Cambridge Boat race, still
attract large crowds.
A more recent development in rowing is recreational and Masters rowing. In an attempt
to regain popularity in the sport, many clubs in North America are offering less
competitive recreational programs and encouraging older Masters rowers to participate.
This is probably a positive move in at least two reasons. One is that the sport will attract

many more participants. However, the other equally important reason is that the sport
might dispense some of the "elitist" image many people have of the sport as an "English
old-boy" sport.

Tiger Woods
One of the most dramatic moments in golf occurred on April 13, 1997. On that day,
Eldrick "Tiger" Woods, at the young age of 21, won the prestigious Masters golf
tournament. Not only was Woods the youngest ever to perform the feat, Woods' score of
270 set a record for the tournament. His victory was also seen by many as a symbolic
victory over years of racism in the sport of golf, and U.S. society in general. Woods'
victory in 1997 came just two days after the fiftieth anniversary of the day American
baseball players broke the colour barrier in professional baseball. Also, Woods' victory
came in a sport long recognized for racial exclusion. The Augusta National Golf Club
excluded blacks from playing in the Masters tournament until 1975, and the Professional
Golfers Association only removed its "Caucasians only" rule in 1961.
Woods was born in the state of Florida in 1975. He rose to fame quickly, winning the US
amateur tournament from 1994-96, National Collegiate Athletic Association champion in
1996, and US Junior championship from 1991-1993. In the first year that Woods turned
professional, it is estimated that over $650 million (U.S.) in extra revenue was generated
in golf. Television ratings soared in the sport, and the Professional Golfers Association
negotiated huge contracts with American television networks as a result of Woods' fame.
Woods has also negotiated record-breaking private sponsorship deals with major firms
such as Nike, Buick, Titleist, American Express, and many others. In fact, Woods
negotiated deals in the millions even before he turned professional. Truly an international
sports celebrity, Woods sees himself as someone destined not only to be a great athlete,
but also a person who will have some significant social or political impact on the world. It
is not clear, however, what that impact will be. But there is little question that he will be
one of the, if not the, richest athletes in history. Woods is destined not just to be a multi-
millionaire, but a billionaire.
Heralded by some as the first black champion in a traditionally racially secluded sport,
he has also been received more cautiously by those who see the limitations of using
black sports stars as role models for youth. Only a tiny fraction of African Americans
have even a remote chance of becoming sports stars in any sport, especially golf. The
odds, in fact, are so small that there is a much greater chance of winning a lottery.
However, by some accounts as many as 80% of African American youth aspire to make a
living from playing sports. Meanwhile, 45% of African American children live below the
poverty line in the U.S.
If the trajectory of Woods' career continue on its current path, it is possible he will satisfy
his father's wishes for Tiger: "to make an impact on the world. . .it will be spiritual and
humanitarian and will transcend the world of golf."

Article #78
Globalization and Sport
One of the most recognized and widely debated terms in recent times is "globalization."
While there is little consensus as to what it actually is, there is little doubt that the world

66 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
has in one way or another become more inter-connected. Mass communications and
transportation technology, in addition to the rise of transnational corporate culture, have
combined to produce a new global culture.
At the same time, sport has become one of the most recognized elements of global
culture. In fact, it has been claimed that there are no other events in the world that attract
the attention of more people around the world than sports events, especially the Olympic
Games and the World Cup football (soccer) tournament. It is difficult to think of other
events that attract the world's attention in the same manner as sport.
Global themes infuse international sporting events in several ways. One of those ways is
in advertising. Major transnational corporations using major events like the Olympic
Games advertise with global themes and images. In addition, media coverage of major
events often emphasizes national and international themes. These themes can be both
positive and negative. For example, sport can reinforce international cooperation and
cultural learning, but it can also be used to reinforce themes of aggressive nationalism
and create tension between countries. This was clearly the case during the Cold War
from World War II to the late-1980s, in which West Bloc and East Bloc nations regularly
did battle at the Olympic Games.
More recently, additional global themes have appeared. The international immigration
and movement of athletes is one theme. Increasingly, professional and elite amateur
athletes are attracted to other. Football (soccer) is one sport that practices "athlete
immigration" frequently. Many professional teams in Europe, for example, have many
players from outside the team's nation.
An additional global theme that has appeared lately is sport used for international
advertising and marketing. Sport provides a very useful device for transnational
marketing and advertising because the symbols provided by sport are often recognizable
internationally, and sport provides many of the themes and images important to
advertising: speed, strength, competition, perseverance, and so forth. Major
corporations such as IBM and Coca-Cola regularly use sport to advertise their products,
even though these corporations don't sell sport-related products directly.
Some critics have claimed that major international events such as the Olympic Games
are being used less for international understanding and culture sharing as they are for
making big corporations a lot of money. While it is clear that the sport-related images
and symbols used by these corporations are recognized worldwide, it is not so clear
what positive benefits are accrued from this. In any case, there is little doubt that sport
will continue to play a vital role in the globalization process.
