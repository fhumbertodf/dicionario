Arthur Ashe
Arthur Ashe (1943-1993) was one of the most exceptional tennis players in the history of
the sport. Born in Richmond, Virginia, Ashe served in the United States Army and had a
good early amateur career. By the end of his life in 1993, Ashe was recognized not only
for his tennis, but also for his political campaigns on behalf of racial equality in the
United States, Haiti, and South Africa. Also, as a victim of AIDS, Ashe campaigned for
AIDS research near the end of his life.
When Ashe turned professional in 1969, he was an African American player in a sport
completely dominated by whites. At the peak of his career in the 1970s, Ashe won the
Australian Open, Wimbledon, and doubles titles at the French and Australian Opens.
Interestingly, Ashe encouraged young blacks not to waste their energies on sports.
Instead, he recommended channeling energy into academic and vocation-related studies.
His recommendation seems appropriate to this day. While it is the case that sports can
provide positive role models and encourage hard work and discipline, it is also the case
that many young athletes dream unrealistically of professional careers at the exclusion
of school. The odds of successfully making a professional league are statistically next to
impossible. Despite his own success, Ashe recognized this.
Mindful of racism in American society, Ashe always thought of his own career in terms of
the general experience of blacks in America. He wrote several books recounting these
ideas. Ashe's historical writing on the history of African Americans in sport spawned a
multimedia series, A Hard Road to Glory.
Today, while a few more blacks have been successful in sports traditionally dominated
by whites, it is still the case that whites dominate. The recent successes of athletes like
the Williams sisters in tennis and Tiger Woods in golf sometimes conceal the fact that
these sports are still predominantly white. According to Ashe's thinking, it would be a
mistake to take one role model, such as Tiger Woods, and from that conclude that race
problems in sport no longer exist. Like any institution, race relations in sport should be
thought of for their long-term trends, not individual exceptions.
Arthur Ashe contracted the HIV virus through a blood transfusion and died of AIDS in
1993, aged 50. While since his death he has become revered and respected, in the 1980s
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

near the end of his life he was unpopular for his ideas. However, his combination of
political campaigning and athletic prowess has made him a revered figure in American
history.

Article #83
Bjorn Borg
The professional career of tennis player Bjorn Borg was one of the most interesting ones
in recent sports history. Borg's success in his sport came at an early age. Borg won
Wimbledon when he was only 20 years old. However, by the time he was 26, and in the
prime of his career, Borg inexplicably retired from professional tennis.
Borg, who began playing tennis at the age of nine, was the number one ranked junior
player by the age of 14, and had won the Italian and French Open titles at the age of 18.
These were the first of several major championships won by Borg in the late-1970s and
early-1980s. Probably his greatest achievement was a winning streak at Wimbledon that
spanned five years. Between the years 1976 and 1982, Borg enjoyed almost complete
dominance in competitive tennis.
His retirement in 1983, then, was a bit of a puzzle. Although his tennis skills waned
somewhat in the previous year, he was still one of the top players on the tour, and only
26 years old. Even stranger was the fact that Borg refused to reveal the reasons for his
retirement.
Following his retirement, Borg encountered a number of personal problems, which kept
him in the media spotlight even though he was no longer playing competitive tennis. Five
years after his retirement, an emergency hospital procedure saved his life. While Borg
claimed he had food poisoning, it was suspected he had a barbiturate overdose. In 1991,
Borg attempted to make a comeback on the professional tennis tour, only to fail
miserably. His insistence on using a wooden racket at the time, when all of the world's
top players were using synthetic fiber rackets didn't help matters. At the same time,
Borg's second wife attempted to commit suicide, and the couple divorced in 1993.
Eventually, Borg disappeared into obscurity, and there is little news of his life today.
These sad stories about the latter part of his career aside, Borg was an important figure
in modern tennis history. He was the sport's first modern media star and icon. Teenage
girls conferred upon him a status comparable to a rock star. His face adorned t-shirts and
other merchandise, making him the most marketable tennis player in history. Borg's
career was a catalyst for Swedish tennis players. Those who followed in his footsteps
and held him up as their hero included tennis stars Mats Wilander and Stephan Edberg.
Perhaps most important of all, Borg gave to the sport of tennis a degree of showmanship,
visibility, and marketability that was used as a role model for the sport in future decades.

Article #84
"Babe" Didrikson
Mildred "Babe" Didrikson (1913-1956) was one of the most celebrated female athletes of
the first half of the twentieth century. Competing in the 1930s and 1940s, when
conventional attitudes regarding women's participation in sport dominated North
American culture, Babe Didrikson rose to fame by dominating not just one, but a number
of sports.
Didrikson flouted conventional notions of femininity and "proper" female activity by
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
71 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
excelling in field events such as javelin and shot-put, in addition to traditionally male-
dominated sports such as baseball, swimming, and golf. Interestingly, Didrikson would
always have to battle popular accounts that attacked or questioned her femininity and
sexuality. As a woman with a large, muscular and athletic body, Didrikson was often
accused of having an "unfair advantage" over other women, and often regarded as not
being a "real woman."
Born in the state of Texas, Didrikson rose to athletic fame quickly, representing the U.S.A.
in the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles where she won and set records in the javelin
and 80 metre hurdles. Later in her career, Didrikson turned her athletic attention mainly
to golf, a sport in which she was immensely successful. Interestingly, however, Didrikson
tired of the popular innuendo regarding her "unfeminine" appearance and made a
conscious effort to change her image in favour of a more traditionally feminine one: she
donned dresses and make-up in place of her sweat pants and makeupless appearance.
Didrikson's controversial career underwent a twist when she fought the American
Athletic Union (AAU), which had stripped her of her amateur sports status after she
allowed her image to be used in endorsements for cars. When offered amateur status
reinstatement, Didrikson refused, challenging what she believed to be the AAU's
antiquated rules and regulations.
Aside from her incredible athletic accomplishments, Didrikson is an important historical
figure because of the challenge she made to the male-dominated institution of sport.
Didrikson challenged those within the institution of sport to question gender values at a
time when the political environment made it difficult to do so. Didrikson prefigured by
several decades the challenges to sport made by other female athletes such as Billie
Jean King, Martine Navratilova, and Florence Griffith Joyner. Didrikson forced a re-
examination of the meaning of sports, making many aware of the social and political
importance of an institution typically not thought of as such.

Article #85
The Dubin Inquiry
The Dubin Inquiry was a Canadian federal government inquiry into the state of amateur
sport in Canada, more specifically into the use of performance-enhancing drugs by
Canadian athletes. The inquiry followed in the footsteps of Canadian sprinter Ben
Johnson's disqualification in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. The inquiry was named after
Charles Dubin, a Canadian judge who presided over the proceedings.
Johnson won the Olympic men's 100-metre final in a world record time of 9.79 seconds.
However, his post-race mandatory drug test was positive. Johnson was found to have
taken the steroid Stanozolol. The subsequent stripping of Johnson's gold medal turned
into probably the most famous case of drug use in the history of sports. It also sent
shock waves rippling through the Canadian sports establishment, with various members
of government and the sport bureaucracy pointing fingers at each other.
Many observers of the sports establishment around the world followed the Dubin Inquiry
and the Johnson case. Several countries were dealing with the growing problem of their
own athletes using drugs to enhance performance, so the results of the inquiry were
eagerly anticipated. The inquiry heard testimony from a large number of athletes,
coaches, sports administrators, and others. The most interesting submissions were
made by Johnson's coach Charlie Francis, his physician Jamie Astaphan, and of course
from Johnson himself. The inquiry disclosed drug taking on a scale never before
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
72 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
suspected. It was discovered that, besides the common practice of coaches encouraging
athletes to take drugs, many others were guilty of turning a 'blind eye' to the problem and
ignoring it.
In the aftermath of the inquiry, a new organization, The Canadian Centre for Drug-Free
Sport, was created to combat the problem. This organization has taken various measures
in its attempt to combat drug use by Canadian athletes. However, critics of the Dubin
Inquiry have accused the inquiry of being little more than a government inquisition, the
real purpose of which was to direct attention towards individual athletes and coaches
and away from the government itself.
Increasingly in the 1980s, Sport Canada-the governing body responsible for the
administration of elite amateur sport in Canada-had taken a "success-oriented" approach
to Canadian sport: emphasizing winning medals above all other goals. The result, critics
have pointed out, was to put immense pressure on Canadian athletes, leading in turn to
drug use--among many other extreme measures--to enhance performance. The Dubin
Inquiry, in other words, has had mixed reviews.
A further indication of the effectiveness of the Dubin Inquiry can be seen in the state of
Canadian sport since the inquiry. Despite attempts by The Canadian Centre for Drug-Free
Sport to educate athletes and coaches on the dangers of drug use, there is little doubt
that rampant drug use continues. This has led some observers of the Canadian sport
scene to claim that drug use is less a reflection of individual athletes who cheat, but
more a reflection of a cultural and institutional epidemic in sport. Drug use has perhaps
become so common in the culture of elite sport that dealing with the problem by
punishing individual athletes might be ineffective.

Article #86
FIFA
Created in 1904 with seven member nations, FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football
Associations) is the international governing body of soccer. Soccer is the most widely
watched and played game in the world. FIFA organizes the World Cup, which takes place
every four years.
In many ways, the development of FIFA follows the organization of the sport of
football/soccer itself. At the start of the twentieth century it was primitive in its
organization and loosely structured. However, by the end of the century, FIFA had
affiliations in all six continents, with over 170 member countries. Alongside the
International Olympic Committee, FIFA is the largest sports organization in the world.
At the time of FIFA's creation, soccer had gained a following in several countries, in large
part due to British settlements. It was not until 1863 that the sports of soccer and rugby
were formally separated in England. While both sports were important in British culture
in the nineteenth century, it was soccer that took off around the world at a much more
accelerated rate. As the twentieth century progressed, countries like Holland, Germany,
Spain, Brazil, and many others became as good as, and in many cases better at the game
than, the founding country.
The World Cup began in 1930 in Uruguay. By then, FIFA had attained enough power and
the game was so widespread that a world championship was justified. By the time the
1998 World Cup was staged in France, 112 countries competed. Despite the sport
originating in England, that country did not win a World Cup until 1966.
One notable exception to the soccer fanaticism that is seen in many countries around the
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
73 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
world is the U.S.A. There has always been a problem developing soccer in the country
that dominates so many other professional and amateur sports. One of the main reasons
for this is the country is inundated with its professional sports system. For one reasons
or another, the U.S.A. has opted for sports traditionally played in relatively few countries:
American-style football, basketball, and what many consider to be the quintessential
American sport, baseball. There is also the problem soccer presents for American
television networks.
Successful sports in the U.S.A. have usually been ones appropriate for commercial
television. Soccer, with its two 45-minute halves and long, uninterrupted play, is less than
ideal for commercials and advertising-based American television.
The most recent evolution in soccer has been in the women's game. The 1999 Women's
World Cup held in the U.S.A. was an unqualified success. Indeed, FIFA's president
proclaimed that "the future of football is female."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #87
International Olympic Committee
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) was formed in 1896 to govern the
organization and development of what were understood to be a modern version of the
Greek Olympic Games. Its first president was Dimitros Vikelas, a Greek, and its secretary
was Frenchman Pierre de Coubertin. De Coubertin's energy and his vision have been the
true inspiration behind the modern Olympic movement.
The IOC has effectively governed the Olympic movement for over 100 years. However,
that period of time has seen many conflicts and controversies within the IOC and in the
Olympic movement as a whole. At first, the main obstacle de Coubertin faced to creating
an international Olympic movement was the lack of organization of sport internationally.
Early sports organizations-most of them amateur-had trouble organizing their own sports
and leagues nationally. As a result, cooperating with the IOC internationally was an
extreme challenge.
In the early years, de Coubertin's own vision for the Games dictated much of the IOC's
policies and procedures. His prejudices also influenced the movement. For example, de
Coubertin was adamant in his rejection of female athletes' participation in the Games. An
embodiment of Victorian ideals and prejudices, de Coubertin thought women's place was
in the home, and bearing and raising children. Indeed, he thought of women's
competition as unnatural, immoral, and "indecent." As a result of de Coubertin's
powerful position within the IOC, it would take many years to have women participating
in any significant way.
The IOC has always claimed a "hands-off" approach to political struggles and
controversies surrounding the Games. Claiming, now for over 100 years, that the IOC is
not a political organization, and that sport in its purest sense (one represented best by
the IOC, of course) is inherently nonpolitical, the IOC has always had trouble answering
critics who point out obvious exceptions to the claim. At the simplest level, the act of
competing under national flags-something the IOC encourages-is a political event. At a
higher political level, the Olympic Games have been used for political demonstration
through boycotts, and the Olympic movement was probably the most visible means of
symbolically fighting the Cold War.
The post-World War II years were lean ones for the Olympic movement. The IOC and
hosting cities and nations often had trouble breaking even. At its worst, the Games went
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
74 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
into great financial debt, most notoriously in the Summer Games in Montreal in 1976.
However, since that time, the Games have taken a more "market friendly" approach,
encouraging private sponsorship and negotiating massive television contracts with
networks around the world, especially those in the U.S.A. As a result, the IOC is a much
more financially solvent organization than it was a few decades ago. However, it is not
clear that the IOC is following its founder's original plan for the movement. After all, de
Coubertin was a pure amateur at heart. The current commercially oriented Olympics
would make de Coubertin concerned, to say the least.

Article #88
Earvin "Magic" Johnson
Earvin "Magic" Johnson is recognized as one of the best basketball players in the history
of the sport. He will also be remembered as the first sports performer of international
stature to declare openly that he had contracted the HIV virus.
Magic Johnson was born in the state of Michigan, and quickly rose to fame in the state
by becoming an outstanding player for Michigan State. At 6 foot 9 inches, Magic was a
formidable player. An enthusiastic sports reporter gave "Magic" the nickname to him
during his high school years. During his college years, he developed a rivalry with
another future National Basketball Association (NBA) superstar, Larry Bird, then playing
for the Indiana State basketball team. Their rivalry would be one of the main forces to
generate interest in the NBA in the early 1980s.
During his playing days in the NBA, from 1979 to 1991, Johnson was named the league's
Most Valuable Player three times. He also became attractive to commercial advertisers
during a period when it had become less taboo to use African American athletes to
endorse products. Johnson, however, was always guarded about his comments
regarding racial issues. However, he was active in charity work, and in general
maintained a very positive light in the public's eye throughout his career.
On announcing his retirement, Johnson stated that he had contracted the HIV virus from
unprotected heterosexual sex. However, tales and rumours circulated in the press and in
popular discourse about Johnson's sexual exploits during his days as a NBA superstar.
Ironically, Johnson, upon retirement, became a spokesperson for safe sex. Another
famous sports star, tennis player Martina Navratilova, criticized Johnson and pointed out
that if the same comments had been made publicly by a female, she would have been
labeled a "slut." Navratilova probably made a good point. Not only was Johnson's public
image a positive one, but also he was actually seen as a role model for heterosexual
family life.
The events and controversies surrounding Johnson's retirement probably raised his
status as an athlete in the public eye, making his career that much more notable. There is
little question, then, that the combination of incredible athletic prowess and the events
surrounding his retirement will bestow upon Magic Johnson a prestigious position in
sports history.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #89
Michael Jordan
Michael Jordan is one of the most recognized sports figures in the world. To understand
the breadth of his fame, it is probably best to think of Jordan in two senses: as a person
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
75 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
and an athlete with incredible athletic prowess and skill, and as a cultural and media icon.
The second way of thinking about Jordan is probably equal to the first. After all, it was
his endorsement of dozens of commercial products, spots in movies, and in general his
commercially- and market-produced image that made Jordan so famous worldwide.
Jordan was born in 1963, one of three sons of a corporate executive. He attended North
Carolina University from 1981-84, and was then drafted to the National Basketball
Association's (NBA) Chicago Bulls. During the same year, he co-captained the U.S.A.
basketball team to gold in the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles.
Jordan's fame was quickly accelerated with the help of his agent and a marketing firm.
After winning the NBA's Rookie of the Year distinction, Jordan quickly began signing a
series of marketing contracts that would eventually create the iconic image known
throughout the world. The most notable marketing endorsement contract came with Nike
Corporation. Nike built much of its marketing and commercial strategy around Jordan in
the 1980s and early 1990s. With his own line of Nike-produced basketball shoes and
clothing, Jordan established himself as a marketable commodity. The relationship
between Nike and Jordan would be a mutually beneficial one. It elevated Jordan to
international prominence, while helping push Nike to number one status as world sports
merchandiser.
Jordan's athletic status was also aided by the fact that his was a career with relatively
little controversy, unlike many other superstar athletes. Social and political controversies
surrounding Jordan were rare, and when they did occur these were minor. In 1992, he got
himself into a bit of trouble when he did not allow his image to be used by the NBA for
the licensing of leisure wear and memorabilia in the run-up to the Summer Olympic
Games. In addition, once at the Games, Jordan, being contractually committed to Nike,
refused to wear the official sponsor Reebok's warm-up suits. The issue was resolved
when Jordan and his teammates wore the U.S. flag and extra long lapels to cover the
Reebok logo.
In 1993, Jordan made a surprise announcement of his retirement from the NBA at the age
of thirty. He signed as a free agent to play Major League Baseball with the Chicago White
Sox, and played-unsuccessfully as it turned out-with the White Sox minor league affiliate.
Jordan then made a brief comeback in the NBA, only to retire soon after. History will
recognize Jordan not only for his athletic prowess-arguably the best the sport of
basketball has ever seen-and for his iconic status in the later-twentieth century world of
sport's marketing and image production.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #90
Billie Jean King
During her competitive days, Billie Jean King was one of the most successful players in
women's tennis. However, King is probably more recognized for her political support of
women's tennis, and her fight to achieve respect for lesbian and gay athletes in tennis,
and in sport in general.
Born in Long Beach, California in 1943 as Billie Jean Moffatt, she began playing tennis at
the age of 11. King learned the game playing on municipal courts, rather than the route
most successful players take in tennis in the private clubs. When King began competing
in the elite levels of tennis, the sport was strictly amateur. She first entered Wimbledon in
1961, and only two years later she advanced to the final. She won her first Wimbledon
title in 1966, at the young age of 22. Her first place prize for winning was a $60 gift
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
76 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
voucher for Harrods department store. By the end of her remarkable career, King would
amass a remarkable 39 Grand Slam titles.
Although women's tennis was amateur, King and a few other players began arguing for
professional status. Indeed, King's competitive performances and training regimen took
on a very professional tone. In fact, it was King, and not men's player John McEnroe,
who started the practice of arguing against umpires' decisions on the court, although it
is the latter player who is better known for such antics. King's training and competitive
practices made her a truly modern and "professional" player, but they also cost her
much public support.
King's major initiative was to start a professional tour, which began in 1968. Operating
outside the auspices of the "official" tournaments and organizations, the new
professional tour had trouble attracting many of the top international players.
Interestingly, Wimbledon allowed professionals soon after King's tour started. The rest of
the world's tours permitted professionals soon after.
Among King's other major political initiatives, she aligned herself with the pro-abortion
movement, Title IX legislation in the U.S. (the purpose of which was to equalize girls' and
women's funding in education), and she negotiated a deal with the Philip Morris Tobacco
Company to set up the Virginia Slims tour. Finally, the famous match between herself and
self-styled "male chauvinist pig" Bobby Riggs in 1973, which King won, brought much
public attention to King and to the growing women's athletic movement.
Finally, in 1981, it was revealed that King had a lesbian relationship with her secretary. At
first King denied the allegation, but later she admitted to the relationship. Instead of
hiding her sexuality, which is what female lesbian athletes had been doing for years,
King was the first major sports superstar to come out. As such, King will be justifiably
recognized as one of the first and most important fighters for the sexual rights of gays
and lesbians in sport.

Article #91
Marathon
Few sports events integrate the competitive side of sport with the social and playful side
of sport like marathon running. This might seem like a strange thing to say about what is
such a rigorous and physically challenging event. However, major city marathons attract
both serious competitors and less serious runners in the same event, and often generate
a citywide party atmosphere leading up to and during the event.
The competitive marathon was introduced as part of the modern Olympic Games in 1896.
The purpose of the event was to mimic the ancient Greek Games, despite the fact that no
such event was held in ancient Greece. However, according to legend, in 490 BC a Greek
soldier ran from Marathon to Athens to take news of a Greek military victory over the
Persians. The runner collapsed with exhaustion and died. Interestingly, the first winner of
the modern-day Olympic marathon in Athens, Greece, was Spiridon Louys, a Greek
runner.
As the twentieth century unfolded, major track and field meets integrated the marathon
into their schedules. However, the marathon grew in popularity due mostly to the
emergence of several urban-based marathons. Some, notably the Boston Marathon, had
been around for decades; however, many new ones emerged, especially in the 1970s and
1980s. The emergence of these popular races coincided with a late-twentieth century
boom in the sports and exercise industry. As a result, the sport of running took off.
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
77 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
Also, lasting images from top international competitions began to attract people to
marathon running. In the Olympic marathon in 1952, Emil Zatopek won the race after
having competed-and also won-in the 5,000 and 10,000 metres races. In 1960 and 1964,
Ethiopian Abebe Bikila won the marathon, making himself a national hero. Images of
Bikila running barefoot in his first victory in 1960 are engrained in most serious
marathoners' minds.
Women entered marathon running in the 1960s and 1970s, although their participation
was met with great resistance. While women had run marathons for decades (the first
recorded time came in 1926 by Violet Percy), it was Kathy Switzer's run in the 1967
Boston marathon that was one of the most important symbolic runs for women. In the
middle of the marathon, a Boston official spotted Switzer running and tried to yank her
off the course. Switzer and fellow supporters resisted, and she went on to finish the race.
Switzer's effort motivated other women to take on marathon running, and the
participation rose, although slowly. It was not until 1984 that the women's marathon was
included in the Olympic program.
Today, major city marathons in Boston, New York, London, Berlin, and cities around the
world make the race one of the most attractive participatory and spectator amateur
sports events in the world.

Article #92
National Football League
The NFL (National Football League) is one of the, wealthiest and most powerful sports
organizations in the world. Many of the single franchises or teams are worth $200-300
million each. As such, each team should be thought of as a major corporation.
American-style football, of which the NFL maintains a complete monopoly over the elite
professional ranks, has its roots in English rugby, which was played in U.S. Eastern
colleges and universities in the nineteenth century. However, rugby did not have features
in keeping with American cultural norms. So U.S. football arose out of norms consistent
with American society, such as clearly measured possession of territory and the
expansion of frontiers through conquering new land.
Walter Camp, a Yale player, devised the rules of the American game. In 1880, he
introduced "downs" into the game, or breaks so that teams could re-assess their
position and prepare for the next attack. This was in stark contrast to rugby's non-stop
and more flowing play. This move would years later be crucial to the sport's success.
With natural breaks in play, the game would be one conducive to American commercial
television, which relies on advertisement breaks for the generation of revenue. Equally
important was the later inclusion of the forward pass into the game. This made the game
appear more offensive, and the famous "Hail Mary" long pass is to this day one of the
most dramatic plays in sport.
Football's success as a dominant American sport (alongside baseball) was secured in
the 1960s with some important contracts with television networks. The ABC television
network sponsored a rival American Football League to compete with the other dominant
National Football League. ABC television did not hide the fact that the rival league was
created for the sole purpose of creating more leverage with advertisers. After gaining
greater legitimacy and earning more revenue, the up-start AFL was able to negotiate
independently with other television networks and sign on big-name players. The most
notable was star quarterback Joe Namath. With the AFL rising as a legitimate business
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
78 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
competitor, the NFL and AFL negotiated a merger, resulting in the NFL league, as it is
known to this day. Since the merger, the NFL has maintained almost a complete
monopoly over American professional football.
Football's success, then, has been a reflection of the ideals of American society and,
more specifically, of American-style commercial enterprise. The league's success has, in
no small part, been due to the relationship between the media and the sport. In a sense,
football is a perfect example of a modern media-generated sport, successfully linking
American norms and values with a sport tailor-made for commercial profit.

Article #93
Jackie Robinson
On April 15, 1947, Jackie Robinson (1919-1972) became the first African American to play
in the Major League Baseball league. On that day, he started for the Brooklyn Dodgers.
The so-called "colour-line" had existed in baseball and many other sports for decades in
American sports: the complete segregation of whites and blacks into separate leagues
and teams.
There had been blacks in the sport of baseball for many years. In fact, in the nineteenth
century blacks had played alongside whites in several leagues in the U.S. However, an
1896 court case reinforced the segregation baseball players according to the colour of
their skin. As a result, black players were excluded from major league baseball, relegated
either to the position of mascot for the Major League team, or forced to organize their
own loosely structured "Negro" teams.
Robinson, the son of a sharecropper and grandson of a slave, excelled in several sports
before serving in the U.S. army. Initially a player in the Negro Leagues, Robinson played
in a period when there was increasing support for breaking down the colour barrier. The
Brooklyn Dodgers' manager took on Robinson mainly because Robinson was a solid
player, not because he was interested in challenging the colour barrier. Also, he felt it
would increase attendance at the Brooklyn games, especially of African American fans.
In 1946, Robinson went to Florida to play for the Montreal Royals, the Dodgers' farm team.
This move was risky on Robinson's part, as racism was still rampant in the U.S.,
especially in the South. In Florida, there were segregation laws that prohibited blacks
and whites from sharing the same restaurants, hotels and other public places, including
the baseball field. Robinson was forced to stay in a "coloureds-only" hotel. It was
believed that there would be a greater chance of Robinson being integrated into the
minor league in the more liberal and open environment of Canada.
Eventually, Robinson played his way into the Major League. However, the transition was
not a smooth one. In his first year, he had many pitches thrown his way and was
regularly taunted by fans and players. However, his season was a successful one, and he
was voted Rookie of the Year. Robinson's Major League career lasted 10 years. Despite
his initial success in breaking the colour line in baseball, it would take many decades
before there would be complete acceptance of black players. To this day, there is under-
representation of blacks in management and coaching positions in baseball.
Robinson died in 1972. His headstone bears an epitaph that he wrote: "A life is not
important except in the impact it has on other lives."

Article #94
Title IX
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
79 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
In 1972, the United States Congress passed Title IX of the Educational Amendments. This
instituted a law that would seriously affect all U.S. educational institutions' sports
programs. The law specified that it was unlawful to discriminate on the basis of sex in
any federally funded education program. This meant, among other things, that boys and
girls, and men's and women's sports programs would have to receive equal funding and
support under the new law.
The law was passed in a time when feminist-inspired movements in many countries
around the world were fighting for equality for women. While Title IX was a law directed
at equality in education in general, it is sports programs that received the most attention.
This was perhaps because of the visibility of sports and the prominent place they play,
especially in American post-secondary education. Initially, Title IX met with mixed
reviews. Especially vocal in opposition to the law were those who had a lot invested in
men's sports programs in the bigger educational institutions. Also, those that had
administered male sports programs for years felt that the changes necessary to conform
to Title IX's standards would be difficult and expensive.
In the aftermath of Title IX, a battle emerged between the National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) and a group that had administered women's sports, the Association
of Intercollegiate Athletics for Girls and Women (AIAW). The NCAA had avoided
equalization for years, being devoted almost exclusively to men's sport. In fact, it was in
opposition to the NCAA that the AIAW formed in the first place. However, with federal
funding now legally devoted to equalization, the NCAA made an about-turn and suddenly
supported equalization. In what many consider to be an obvious and unfortunate power
move, the NCAA absorbed the AIAW. The long-term effects of this move were to wrestle
control of women's sport out of the hands of women. The AIAW was administered by
women for women; however, with the take-over the administration of women's sport fell
into the hands of men.
Title IX did not manage to equalize funding between the sexes, at least not at first. The
legislators of Title IX probably couldn't imagine the resistance to equalization in sport
that would emerge. Nor did they probably realize the extent of male privilege in school
sport, especially at the upper, more elite levels. Almost thirty years after the legislation,
there is still not equalization in many cases, although an increasing number of schools
have fallen in line with the law.
Today, women's sport has achieved a much higher level of respectability and support in
schools. However, there is still resistance to complete equalization, and female-
supportive administrators continue to fight legal battles in support of girls' and women's
participation in sport.

Article #95
O. J. Simpson
It has been argued that the trial of Orenthal James (O.J.) Simpson for murder was the
defining cultural experience of the U.S. in the 1990s. It dominated the front pages of
newspapers in the U.S. and many other countries for several months. Indeed, Simpson
was for a period of time probably the most talked about person in the world, but very few
of the discussions were about his athletic career.
Until his internationally famous trial, Simpson was a relative unknown outside the U.S. A
very wealthy and highly decorated former professional football player, Simpson made the
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
80 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
transition to acting and television commentating after his illustrious football career.
However, when he was charged in June of 1994 with the murder of his estranged wife
Nicole Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman, and after his dramatic suicide getaway
attempt captured by television cameras, Simpson became known throughout the world
almost overnight.
Simpson was born in San Francisco in 1947 to a poor family. His father abandoned the
family, and it was his mother who encouraged Simpson to pursue sport, mainly to
compensate for some physical problems he had developed as a child. Simpson became
a solid baseball and football player early in his life and went on to enroll in the City
College of San Francisco, where he continued to play impressive football. With offers
from over fifty other universities to play football, Simpson went to the University of
Southern California. There, he played out a distinguished college career and earned
himself the 1968 Heisman Trophy for top college player in the U.S.
Simpson began his professional career by dropping out of school before graduation and
immediately signing a three-year endorsement deal with Chevrolet for $250,000. Drafted
by the Buffalo Bills in 1969, the first few years of Simpson's professional career were
undistinguished ones. However, from 1972 on, a new coach for the team made Simpson
the central figure in the team's offence. As a result, Simpson would go on to shatter
several running records in the National Football League. At the conclusion of his career,
Simpson was inducted into the Professional Football Players' Hall of Fame.
After his professional football career, stories about Simpson's alleged abuse of his wife
began circulating. Nicole Simpson made the first call to police after an incident at a 1989
New Year's Eve party, in which Simpson was fined $200. Over the next few years Nicole
would make thirty emergency calls to the police, none of which led to formal charges.
After the incidents surrounding Nicole's death and Simpson's subsequent flight from
police, an exhaustive months-long trial ensued, leading to Simpson's famous acquittal.
More than just a murder trial, however, O.J. Simpson's trial highlighted the racial
tensions in the U.S. In fact, history will undoubtedly remember Simpson more for his trial
than for his illustrious football career.

Article #96
Fosbury Flop
American athlete Dick Fosbury devised the high jump technique known as the "Fosbury
Flop." His new technique revolutionized one of the oldest events in track and field
competition. While Fosbury never broke the world record using his new technique, other
high jumpers were inspired by his gold medal at the 1968 Summer Olympic Games in
Mexico City, where he introduced his new jumping technique.
Fosbury was born in 1946 in Oregon and went to Oregon State University. He won the
gold medal in the Olympic Games at the very young age of 21. It was assumed that his
odd-looking new method for clearing the bar was based on a careful study of the physics
and biomechanics of high jump technique. However, Fosbury claimed it was the product
of pure intuition.
Prior to Fosbury's invention, most high jumpers used a "straddle" technique. In this
older style of jumping, the front leg led the jumper up and over the bar in a face down
position. Fosbury's technique involves approaching the bar in a curve with a last second
acceleration. Then, at the point of take-off, the body rotates, positioning the back to the
bar and leaping backwards. The head faces the sky as the body arches over the bar with
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
81 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
the mid-body and legs trailing behind.
Fosbury had begun experimenting with the technique when he was only sixteen years
old. In a meet in 1968 in which Fosbury used his new technique, a local newspaper's
headline read, "Fosbury flops over the bar." Thus, the name of the newly invented
technique was born.
Since Fosbury's competitive days, his technique has been widely copied. Once
experienced jumpers mastered the technique, records started to fall in the sport, due
mostly to the Fosbury Flop, but also to better equipment and running surfaces. Dick
Fosbury will always be known for his revolutionizing of the sport of high jump.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #97
Free Agency
"Free agency" refers to the ability of athletes to negotiate their own contracts and
working conditions in professional sport. Before the 1970s, most professional sports had
some sort of reserve system for athletes. In their reserve systems, players were forced to
play for a single team-usually for the duration of their careers-under the conditions set
by the team owner and the league bosses.
Historically, the sport of baseball had the most notorious reserve system, which had
been intact and strictly enforced for decades. The purpose of the reserve system was to
allow owners of professional teams to control the movement of players and reduce their
salaries. By being forced to play for only one team, players had little choice but to accept
the contractual terms and conditions set out for the player. The player, in short, did not
have the freedom to offer and negotiate his services on the open market, as is done on
all other industries. This significantly reduced owners' payroll expenses, and increased
profits greatly. In North America, the major professional leagues-in the sports of baseball,
football, hockey and basketball-all had some form of reserve system.
In the late-1960s and 1970s, however, the reserve system encountered a number of
challenges. The most important challenge came from a baseball player, Curt Flood of the
St. Louis Cardinals. Flood refused the terms of a trade and offered his services on the
open market of the Major League Baseball. When no offers were made, Flood filed suit in
American courts under the Sherman Antitrust Act, which makes it unlawful for any
business or combination of businesses to maintain a monopoly in any commercial
industry. While Flood did not win the case, a series of subsequent legal decisions made
it apparent that baseball owners had unreasonable control over their labourers-the
players.
The baseball players' union became more militant as a result of the Flood case. In 1976, a
court decision granted players free agency and the right to negotiate the conditions of
their labour services much more freely than they had in the past. The move to free
agency changed the character of the relations between professional sports clubs and
their owners.
Previously, owners worked or colluded together to limit the movement of players.
Professional sports clubs acted like a well-organized club. Free agency meant a more
competitive environment for players, and of course player salaries have risen
substantially as a result.
Today, sports fans often complain that players' salaries are too high. While certainly at
times it seems difficult to justify the huge salaries of today, it should be kept in mind that
before the current era of free agency and big contracts, players barely made a
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

subsistence wage, and often worked under conditions of servitude. The situation now
might be less than perfect; however, it's certainly a vast improvement over the pre-free
agency days.

New Zealand
New Zealand is a country that is located in the South Pacific ocean. The country is made
up of two large islands, the North Island and the South Island, which are separated by a
narrow channel of water. Although New Zealand has many beautiful mountains and
forests, much of the land is used for farming. In fact, New Zealand has almost 70 million
sheep, but only four million people! New Zealand's farms are also famous for their
delicious fruit, especially apples and kiwi fruit.
About ten percent of the people who live in New Zealand belong to an ethnic group called
the Maori. The Maori came to New Zealand by boats from small Polynesian islands. They
arrived about 1000 years ago, and lived by farming, hunting, and fishing. About 200 years
ago, many more people came to New Zealand. These people were from the British Isles,
and they came to New Zealand to begin farms. Today, most of the people of New Zealand
are descended from people who came from Britain.
During the 19th century, some wars started between the Maori and the British settlers.
After years of fighting, the two sides signed a treaty to end the wars. Today the Maori
have achieved equal rights, but there are still some disagreements about land ownership.
In recent years, many more people have come to New Zealand, mostly from Asian
countries and from other Pacific Islands.
There are three large cities in New Zealand. Auckland is the largest city, with more than
one million people. It is located in the northern part of the North Island. The capital city of
New Zealand is Wellington. It is located in the southern part of the North Island. The
largest city of the South Island is Christchurch. The cities of New Zealand are very
modern and clean. Many tourists enjoy visiting the cities of New Zealand, but they also
enjoy the beautiful countryside. New Zealand is an excellent place for outdoor recreation,
such as climbing or walking.
Most of New Zealand has a mild, or temperate, climate. The summer is not very hot, and
the winter is not very cold. Because New Zealand is in the southern part of the world,
summer begins in December and winter begins in June. The South Island is cooler than
the North Island, but both islands have similar amounts of rain. This rain gives the fields
and forests of New Zealand a beautiful green colour. Each year, many tourists visit New
Zealand, to experience the beautiful countryside and the interesting cultures of its people.

Article #99
Track and Field
In many parts of the world, the sport of track and field is very popular. Actually, the sport
of track and field includes many different sports. In some of these sports, the athletes
run on a track. The athletes race against each other to find out who can run the fastest.
Some of these track events require great speed for a short distance. In the 100 metre race,
the athletes must sprint as quickly as possible. Some athletes can run 100 metres in only
10 seconds!
Other track races are much longer, and these events require great endurance. In the
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
83 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
marathon, the athletes must run a distance of 42 kilometres. Because this is such a long
distance, the athletes cannot run too quickly at the start. Instead, it is important to run at
a steady pace and keep some energy for the end of the race. Some athletes can run the
marathon in little more than two hours!
Some races are called middle distance races because the distance is not very short, yet it
is also not very long. For example, the 1500 metres requires a mixture of speed and
endurance. Some athletes can run the 1500 metres in less than four minutes! There are
also some track events for people who use a wheelchair. Wheelchair athletes can race
even faster than athletes who run!
Some of the races on the track are for teams of four runners. Each athlete carries a small
stick called a baton. After running a certain distance, the runner must hand the baton to a
team-mate, who then runs with the baton. To win this race, the team's runners must be
very fast, but they must also cooperate very well with each other.
In the field events, athletes compete by jumping or throwing. In the long jump, the
athletes run up to a line, and then try to jump as far forward as possible. In the high jump,
the athletes must try to jump over a very high bar. Another field event is called the shot
put. In this event, the athletes try to throw a heavy metal ball as far as possible. Yet
another field event is called the javelin throw. In this event, the athletes try to throw a
long spear as far as possible. Athletes who compete in the throwing events must be very
strong!
Both men and women compete in the sport of track and field. Many boys and girls enjoy
track and field as part of their education in school. Those boys and girls who have much
talent, and who work very hard, might someday compete in the Olympics. But for most
people, track and field is just a fun and healthy way to get exercise and to make friends.

Article #100
Thomas Edison
Thomas Edison was one of the most famous inventors of all time. He was born in a small
town in the United States during the year 1847. When he was a young boy, Thomas found
school to be very boring. A teacher once told Thomas's mother that he believed the
young boy was rather stupid. However, Edison's mother knew better. She understood
that her son was very intelligent. She then took him away from school and began to
teach him herself.
As a young man, Thomas Edison became very interested in inventing new machines.
One of his first inventions was a small electrical machine that could be used for counting
votes. However, the government was not interested in his invention. But Edison was not
discouraged. He continued inventing, and his next invention was an electrical machine
that could be used for recording the prices of stocks. This invention was very popular
and successful.
Probably the most famous invention of Edison's is the electric light bulb. Before Edison,
there had been some electric lights, but these were very expensive. In 1879, Edison
invented a new kind of light bulb that could shine for a long time. Within a few years,
Edison's electric lights were used on the streets of cities in many countries. Soon after,
people began using electric lights in their homes.
Another invention of Edison's is no longer used today. That invention was called the
phonograph. It was a machine that could be used to record sounds, such as music and
conversation. When Edison invented this machine, in 1877, it was the first time that
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
84 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
anyone had been able to preserve sounds. Today, people do not use the phonograph any
more. Instead, they use compact discs (or CDs) to record music and other sounds.
Edison also helped to improve some inventions that already existed. For example, he
made improvements to the telephone and to the cameras that are used in making movies.
However, Edison is most famous for his inventions, such as the light bulb and the
phonograph.
Edison lived to an old age, and he died in 1931. Although Edison was an extremely
creative man, he believed that his success was due to many hours of hard work. He once
said that "Genius is one per cent inspiration, and ninety-nine percent perspiration." In
other words, a successful person should have good ideas, but the most important thing
is to work very hard.

Article #1
Come to the Fair
Fall fairs have been a feature of North American life since early in the nineteenth century.
At the end of the harvest, people from rural areas have come together to celebrate.
Usually, these fairs take the form of a competition regarding the best of all farm products
of that year. Depending on the part of the country, and its most important crop, fall fairs
can begin as early as August or as late as November. They usually last several days.
When the United States and Canada were organized, they were divided into small units
called counties. Larger units were called states or provinces. Many of the best-known
fairs are county fairs or state fairs. There are also smaller local fairs, and larger ones too,
like the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Ontario.
Since these fairs are usually annual events, many have developed permanent buildings
over the years. Most of these are large barn-like structures. These buildings are used to
display new products for farm life, such as tractors, home furnishings and water systems.
Several barns are usually necessary to house all the horses, cows, pigs, goats, sheep,
chickens and other animals in competition. There must also be room to display all the
vegetables, berries and fruits in competition. Finally, there is space for handicrafts,
artwork, baked goods, and jams and jellies.
Usually, there is a grandstand, which is a stage with wooden seats around it. Here
entertainers perform for an audience during the fair. Country and western singers are
usually popular at fairs, but so are comedians, clowns, dancers and musicians. There
may also be other contests such as a beauty competition for queen of the fair, tests of
strength for the men or pie-eating events. Most fairs also have a racetrack, which is used
for horse racing, or, in some cases, auto-racing.
Fairs have helped to improve animal breeds, and races encourage the breeding of fast
horses. Ploughing contests test the strength and steadiness of horses, and so do pulling
contests. This spirit of competition has led to improvements in all areas of farming. Every
kind of grain, fruit, vegetable, berry and animal is tested, and only the best win a ribbon.
This encourages fairness to improve their products.
Farm women compete to produce the best homemade food and crafts. Many kinds of
fruit and vegetables are stored in glass jars for the winter. The best of these also receive
prizes. Most fairs have a dining area where this good food is served to the public.
The goal of improving farming is sponsored by the governments of Canada and the
U.S.A. Four-H Clubs are youth organizations that encourage farm children to take an
interest in farming. Four-H Clubs aim at improving the heads, hearts, hands and health of
their members. There are also women's organizations, such as the Women's Institutes in
Canada, which work to make the life of farm families better. Fall fairs have taken over the
idea of the midway from the circus. The midway has rides like Ferris wheels, merry-go-
rounds, and roller coasters. It also has games of chance and skill, such as trying to
throw a small hoop over a large bottle. One nice thing about fall fairs is that they are fun
for the whole family. Children enjoy the midway and the farm animals. Women like the
crafts, food and household exhibits. Men like the machinery, the horse races and the crop
exhibits. Everyone likes the grandstand shows. Nowadays, not so many people live on
farms. But people from towns and cities still enjoy going to fall fairs. They are part of our
North American heritage.

Hiroshima
North American children know about Hiroshima. They are taught about the dangers of
nuclear war. Sometimes they learn the details of the damage that was done. They learn
about what happened at 8:15 am on August 6, 1945. People were eating breakfast;
children were going to school and adults going to work. There was a blinding flash of
light, a scorching heat, and a mushroom cloud rose up. People close to the explosion
were instantly vaporized. Many of those further away would die from burns and radiation.
Sixty thousand houses were destroyed immediately. One concrete structure remained
standing, although it was damaged. The local government left the Atomic Dome standing
as a memorial to the explosion.
Even those who were not seriously injured in the explosion later became very ill. They
became very sick from radiation poisoning. Many developed leukemia. Sadako Sasaki
was two years old when the bomb exploded. She was apparently uninjured and grew up
normally until she was twelve. Then she developed leukemia, a disease of the blood and
bone marrow. Sadako began to fold paper cranes to protect her from the illness. However,
she died in 1955 before she reached 1,000 paper cranes. Her example inspired the
Children's Monument at Hiroshima.
There is a Peace Museum in Hiroshima which has objects left by the explosion. These
include bottles, metal, stones and tiles twisted into strange shapes by the heat. There are
objects on which people were vaporized, so that their shape appears like a shadow on
the material. There are bits of burnt clothing and many photographs.
Why was the bomb dropped? World War II was a long and bitter war. The rules of war,
which said not to kill civilians, were forgotten. Hitler bombed London, hoping to break
the spirit of the English. Then England bombed Germany to destroy the factories and kill
the people who worked in them. Americans wanted revenge for the Japanese attack on
Pearl Harbor. The U.S. government had spent six billion dollars developing the A-bomb
and wanted to use it. Some say that they also wanted to warn the Russians not to cause
trouble for America.
When American forces advanced on Japan in 1945, they had to decide what to do. Would
Japan surrender, or would they fight to the last soldier? American leaders feared that
they might lose many men by an invasion. Dropping the atomic bomb would end the war
very quickly. President Truman made the decision to use it.
Since then, most people have felt that this decision was wrong. It was such a terrible
thing to do to people - children, old people, women, men and babies. Hiroshima inspired
many people to try to "ban the bomb." They wanted to ensure that atomic bombs would
not be used again. Even some of the scientists and aircrews involved in making and
dropping the bomb at Hiroshima wanted it banned. Perhaps if we can all remember what
happened that day, there will be no more Hiroshima's.

Niagara Falls
Niagara Falls is one of the world's leading tourist attractions. Millions of people around
the world visit here each year. Summers at the Falls are especially busy, with traffic jams
and parking problems. However, the Falls are beautiful in winter too.
Many have asked why people travel so far to see water falling over a cliff. The size and
beauty of Niagara Falls help to make it special. While many falls are higher than Niagara,
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
5 | Pagewww. irlanguage .com
very few are as wide or have such a volume of water. It also helps that Niagara is
relatively easy to travel to.
When the first Europeans came to Niagara, the Falls were surrounded by forest. The
noise of the Falls could be heard miles away, before they were actually seen. The first
visitors were filled with horror at the sight.
Later, fear ceased to be the main emotion inspired by the Falls. Later, visitors were
impressed by the beauty and grandeur of the Falls, which overwhelmed them with
wonder.
By the 1830s, people were able to come to the Falls by railway. As more and more people
came, the tourist industry developed. Early tourism was not well regulated, and there
were many complaints about cheats and swindles. Today, there are similar complaints
about tourist junk and high prices.
The majority of tourists stay on the Canadian side. There are two falls, separated by an
island. Since the Niagara River forms the boundary here between Canada and the United
States, each country has one of the falls. The Canadian Horseshoe Falls is wider and
more impressive than the American Rainbow Falls. About nine times more water goes
over the Canadian Falls. Nonetheless, there is much to be seen on the American side.
The island in the middle, Goat Island, is one of the best places to view the falls and
rapids. It is on the American side.
Newly married couples began coming to Niagara Falls when it was still a secluded,
peaceful and romantic spot. It is still popular with newly-weds as a relatively inexpensive
and convenient place to spend their honeymoon.
Besides being beautiful, Niagara Falls is also very useful. Their falling water is the power
behind several of the largest hydroelectric stations in the world. Much of the electric
power used in this part of North America comes from Niagara Falls. In order to harness
this power, half of the flow of water is channeled away from the falls during the night, and
during the non-tourist season. Probably most visitors don't notice the difference.
Niagara has attracted many kinds of people over the years. Businessmen have come to
profit from the tourists. Daredevils have come to make a name for themselves. Some
have gone over the falls in a barrel, while others have walked above the falls on a
tightrope. Poets and artists have visited here to capture its beauty. Lovers have come to
gaze on its romantic scenery. All of these, and many others, have helped to make Niagara
Falls world famous.

Cowboys
The Golden Age of the American cowboy was short lived. It began in the 1860s with the
great cattle drives from Texas north to Kansas. By 1890, when railroads had reached
remote areas, there was no more need for large-scale cattle drives.
Of course, cowboys have a history before 1860. In fact, there were Mexican cowboys
long before that. The Spanish conqueror of Mexico, Hernan Cortes, brought cattle with
him 1521. Cortes also branded his cattle with a three cross design. The Spanish sharp-
horned cattle roamed the deserts and prairies freely. Eventually, they found their way to
Texas. American settlers in Texas interbred their animals with the Spanish breed - the
Texas longhorn cow was the result! It was famous for its bad temper and aggressiveness.
The Longhorn was a dangerous animal, with each of its horns measuring up to three and
one-half feet long.
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

After the American Civil War ended in 1865, disbanded soldiers, who were former black
slaves, and young men seeking adventure headed west. At that time, there were about
five million cattle in Texas. Back in the East, there was a big demand for beef. By this
time, railways from the east extended as far west as Kansas. It was still more than 600
miles from South Texas to the railway. Between the two places there were rivers to cross,
Indian tribes, badlands and other problems. A fur trader named Jesse Chisholm had
driven his wagon north in 1865. Cowboys and cattle followed the Chisholm Trail north to
Abilene, Kansas. This cattle trail became the most famous route for driving cattle, until it
was barred with barbed wire in 1884.
In 1867, cattle dealer Joseph G. McCoy built pens for 3,000 cattle in the little town of
Abilene. Soon Abilene was the most dangerous town in America. After the long cattle
drive, cowboys who had just been paid went wild. Sheriff "Wild Bill" Hickok tamed
Abilene in 1871 by forcing cowboys to turn over their guns when they arrived in town.
Other towns replaced Abilene as the wildest town in the West - Newton, Wichita,
Ellsworth and Dodge City.
In Kansas a herd of 3,000 Texas longhorns might sell for $100,000 making the rancher
rich. The cowboys might get $200 in wages, which often disappeared on drink, women
and gambling.
Getting cattle to Kansas was far from easy. One of the biggest difficulties was getting the
herd across rivers, especially when the river was high. There were no bridges. In 1871,
350 cowboys driving 60,000 cattle waited two weeks for the water level in the Red River
to go down.
Food for men and animals was also difficult to find at times. An early cattleman
developed the chuck wagon, which were both a supply wagon and a portable kitchen.
In the 1870s, there were probably 40,000 cowboys in the West. After the prairies were
fenced in, there was less work. Large ranches still employ cowboys to round up the
cattle for branding or for sale. Even today, about 20,000 cowboys still work in North
America.

Article #5
George W. Bush Jr.
George W. Bush Jr. was inaugurated as the 43rd President of the United States on
January 20, 2001. Of course, people knew that he was the son of the 41st President,
George H. W. Bush. He had also been Governor of Texas since 1994. However, aside from
this, he was not very well known outside of Texas. Why then did so many people want
him to run for president in 2000?
Many republicans thought that the democrats could be defeated in 2000. But they
themselves lacked a candidate with strong appeal. As the election approached, leading
publicans worried about whom to support. Some of the most powerful republicans were
state governors. They began to look around at each other for a possible candidate. Most
eyes turned to George W. Bush, the Governor of Texas. In November 1998, Bush was re-
elected as Governor by an impressive margin. By now, Bush was the leading republican
candidate in the polls.
Of course, one advantage that Governor Bush had was a familiar name. In fact, when he
did well in some early polls, it is likely that some people really voted for his father. They
thought that George H. W. Bush was running again. The Bush family was able to swing a
lot of support to George W. It also helped that his brother, Jeb, was now Governor of

Florida.
Parents George and Barbara were both born in eastern United States. But in 1948,
George moved to Texas where he made a fortune in the oil business. He went into
politics in the 1960s and 70s and served in a number of important positions. He was
Ronald Reagan's Vice President from 1981-1989, and President from 1989-1993.
George W. was born in 1946, the oldest of the Bush children. Three more brothers and
two sisters were also born. The youngest sister died of leukemia as a child.
George W. attended the same prestigious eastern colleges as his father. Then he came
back to Texas and was a fighter pilot with the Texas Air National Guard. During the early
'70s he wandered from place to place, trying different jobs. After attending Harvard
Business School from 1972 to 1975, he came back to Texas and started his own oil
exploration company. Although it wasn't as profitable as his father's company, he
eventually sold his stock shares for a considerable amount of money.
In 1978, he ran for the Senate of the United States but was defeated. He became closely
involved in his father's campaign for president in 1988. Here he developed a lot of the
political skills he was later able to use to run for office himself.
In 1989, back in Texas, George W. organized a group that bought the Texas Rangers
baseball team. He later sold the team in 1998 and made a $14 million dollar profit.
In 1994, he surprised the political world by defeating the incumbent Governor of Texas.
As Governor, he pushed ahead with an energetic program, which reflected neo-
conservative values. However, George W. did not appear as an ideologist to people. Even
his opponents were willing to work with him. When he ran for president in 2000, Bush
described himself as a "compassionate conservative." Only time will tell how successful
Bush will be as U.S. President.

Handel's "Messiah"
George Frederick Handel was a native of Germany and spoke with a German accent all
his life. Most of that life, however, was spent in London, England. As a young musician,
Handel's sponsor was the Elector of Hanover. Later on, when the Elector became King
George I of England, he continued to sponsor Handel.
The young Handel went to Italy to study opera. Opera had become a very fashionable
entertainment for the upper classes. Handel traveled to England in 1711 and made an
immediate success with his operas. Queen Anne granted him a royal pension for life in
1713. Because of this initial success, Handel tried to start a permanent opera company in
London. But this failed and Handel lost money.
Since operas used full stage settings with costumes, scenery and props, they were
expensive to produce. Handel decided to produce oratorios in which the parts were
simply sung without actions.
On August 22, 1741, Handel began to work on his oratorio "The Messiah." The text was
made up of passages from the Bible relating to the birth, life and death of Jesus. Handel
worked on it feverishly, missing meals and going without sleep. He finished it twenty-four
days later. When he was asked how he felt on completing it, Handel said, "I thought I saw
all Heaven before me, and the great God Himself."
In the fall of 1741, Handel received an invitation from the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to
present operas and concerts there. Handel traveled from London to Dublin with his entire
luggage and many of his singers. However, in order to rehearse on the way, he had to
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
8 | Pagewww. irlanguage .com
hire local people to fill in. Once, the composer soundly criticized one local singer who
failed to meet his standards.
Handel was warmly received in Dublin, where his concerts were sold out. Even his
rehearsals were considered newsworthy by the local papers. "The Messiah" was first
publicly performed on April 13, 1742. Seven hundred people squeezed into a 600-seat
theatre to hear it. A notice had requested that ladies attend in hoopless skirts, and that
gentlemen come without their swords. A Dublin paper reported, "Words are wanting to
express the exquisite delight it afforded to the admiring crowded audience." All proceeds
were donated to charity, as the church choirs had refused to participate except on those
conditions.
Handel returned to London in August 1742 and prepared the oratorio for the London
stage. "The Messiah" made its London debut on March 23, 1743, with King George II in
the audience. It was during the Hallelujah Chorus that the King jumped to his feet and so
initiated a tradition that has lasted ever since.
With such oratories, Handel was able to re-establish his popularity and restore his
finances in London. "The Messiah" continued to be performed. After conducting it on
April 6, 1759, the old composer collapsed and had to be carried home. He died eight days
later.
"The Messiah" remains Handel's most popular work, combining wonderful music with
inspiring religious sentiments. The Biblical text speaks of hope and salvation, and the
music allows the text to soar into angelic songs.

Article #7
Ireland
Ireland is an island in the Atlantic Ocean just west of Britain. For much of its history, it
has been an advantage to Ireland to be far from the mainland. The Romans or the other
early Empires never conquered Ireland. It was the remoteness of Ireland that helped
preserve much of Christian and classical culture. After the fall of the Roman Empire,
wandering tribes destroyed much of what remained on the continent.
Finally, it was Ireland's turn to be invaded. First, the Norsemen or Vikings attacked during
the 800s and 900s. Then in the 1100s, the English invaded Ireland. Since that time, there
has always been an English presence in Ireland. The conflict between the English and
the Irish grew worse in the 1500s. Then the English became Protestant, and the Irish
remained Catholic. In the 1600s, Oliver Cromwell tried to make Ireland Protestant by
driving out the Catholics and bringing in Protestant settlers. In the centuries following,
Irish Catholics had very few rights in their own country. The Catholic Irish were not
allowed to vote until 1829.
Since Irish Catholics were not allowed to own land, they were poor tenant farmers. They
paid rent to the English landlords. The main food crop in the 1840s was potatoes. When
these became infected by blight, thousands of Irishmen starved. Many others were
evicted from their dwellings because they couldn't pay the rent. Hundreds of thousands
of Irish took ship for North America. The Catholic Irish preferred to go to the United
States because Canada was under British influence. However, many Protestant Irish went
to Canada.
The influence of the Irish on North American culture has been very great in many areas.
Prominent Irish-Americans include Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.
Meanwhile, in Ireland itself, a strong independence movement developed. A rebellion
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
9 | Pagewww. irlanguage .com
against England in 1916 began a struggle that resulted in independence for most of
Ireland. Some Protestant areas in Northern Ireland preferred to stay with England.
Republican groups such as the Irish Republican Army wanted to "liberate" the north from
British rule. Nowadays, conflict between Protestants and Catholics is limited to these
northern counties. Constant attempts are being made to bring the conflict there to an end.
Meanwhile, the Irish Republic, or Eire, has become prosperous again. It can sell its
agricultural products to the European Common Market. Irish beer and whisky are sold all
over the world. Ireland is also becoming known for its high-tech industries. Because of
this relative prosperity, the population is increasing again, after a century and a half of
decline.
The Irish differ from other people because the vast majority of Irishmen live away from
their homeland. However, this exodus from Ireland has helped to spread Irish music,
culture and products around the world. On St. Patrick's Day (March 17th), nearly
everyone becomes Irish for the day. Then there is a great party with Celtic music, Irish
dancing, green beer and the wearing of the green.

Article #8
Louisa May Alcott
New England in the early and middle years of the nineteenth century had a flourishing
culture. People were passionately interested in ideas and education. Most New
Englanders were strongly opposed to slavery. They were also concerned about other
social issues.
New ideas resulted in new kinds of writing. These ideas included the importance of doing
what seemed right for them, no matter how different it was from what other people
thought. People also believed that nature gave them guidance in our lives and that it was
important to live close to nature. These and other ideas were expressed through teaching
and writing.
Bronson Alcott was one of those who looked at the world in a new way. He looked for
work as a teacher so that he could pass on his ideas to others. However, very few
parents wanted Mr. Alcott to teach their children. And very few people were interested in
hearing his speeches or reading his books. As a result, the Alcott family was very poor
Fortunately for Bronson, he married a very capable and energetic woman. Mrs. Abigail
Alcott helped to earn money to support the family and did most of the work involved in
looking after the four Alcott girls. The oldest daughter, Anna, was quiet and serious. She
rarely got into trouble and was a good helper at home. The second daughter was Louisa
May Alcott, who became a writer. She was adventurous and cared very little for rules.
She was always saying and doing things that got her into trouble. The third daughter,
Elizabeth, was very kind and good-natured. All the others loved her. As a young woman,
Elizabeth had a severe case of scarlet fever and never fully recovered. She died at age 23.
The youngest sister, May, was talented, but she was rather spoiled.
Because there was never enough money, the Alcott girls felt pressure to work at an early
age. But this did not stop them from having fun. Louisa wrote little plays that she and her
sisters performed at home. They all enjoyed the woods and ponds around Concord,
Massachusetts, where they live most of these years. When they moved back to Boston in
1848, Anna took a job looking after other people's children, and Louisa looked after the
house. Meanwhile, their mother worked outside the home.
While working on laundry or sewing, Louisa was thinking up stories. At night she would
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
10 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
write them down. When she was eighteen, she began selling poems and stories to
magazines. Within ten years, Louisa was earning a substantial income from writing. One
day her publisher suggested that she write a story for girls. At first Louisa didn't like the
suggestion. But when she started to write, the ideas came rapidly. Her book was based
on her own family and her own childhood.
"Little Women" was published in 1868 and was an immediate success. The March family
was very much like the Alcotts. Mrs. Alcott resembles "Marmee." "Meg" is like Anna, and
"Jo" is like Louisa herself. "Beth" is based on Elizabeth and "Amy" on May Alcott. Many
of the situations in the book happened to the Alcott family. Nonetheless, many characters
and incidents were invented.
"Little Women" and its sequel opened up a new kind of writing for children. While these
books did have a moral, they were more lively and interesting than earlier children's
writing. "Little Women" inspired many writers later to write more realistic accounts of
childhood.

Niagara-On-The-Lake
Niagara-on-the-Lake is a little town at the mouth of the Niagara River. It is only twelve
miles north of Niagara Falls. It used to be true that very few tourists would bother to
travel from the Falls down to Niagara-on-the-Lake. Nowadays, however, the little town
itself is a major tourist attraction.
The town has a remarkable history. The area played an important role in both the
American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. As a result, the little town has two forts,
Fort George and Fort Mississauga. When Fort George was reconstructed for the public in
the 1930s, Niagara-on-the-Lake got its first big tourist attraction.
Because Niagara-on-the-Lake was the first capital of Ontario, it has many significant
"firsts." There was the first parliament in the province, the first legal society, the first
library, the first newspaper, the first museum building, and many more "firsts."
Besides its history, the town, which is bordered by Lake Ontario and the Niagara River,
has beautiful scenery. On a summer's day, visitors can watch the sailboats going out the
river to the lake. On the landside, Niagara is part of the fruit belt of Ontario. Peaches,
pears, apples, cherries and strawberries grow here in abundance. There are also long
rows of vines, and winemaking has recently become a major industry.
The mild humid climate allows plants to flourish. The trees, especially the oaks, grow to
remarkable heights. Flowering trees and shrubs perfume the air in the spring. Gardens
are often spectacular for much of the year. Because of this, Niagara-on-the-Lake attracts
many painters and photographers. Many of the private homes also have a long history,
and great care is taken to keep them looking their best.
The biggest single attraction is the Shaw Festival Theatre. The Festival was founded in
1962 by a group of Shaw enthusiasts. Early productions were often held in the historic
Court House on the main street, and plays still take place there. In 1973, however, a new
861 seat Shaw Theatre was built at the south end of town. Since then, traffic to Niagara-
on-the-Lake has been steady all through the long summer season.
In 1996, Niagara-on-the-Lake was voted "the prettiest town in Canada." Partly, it is the
scale of things that makes the old town so attractive. The old town is only about eight
blocks long by eight blocks wide. It has a population of little more than 1,000 people.
Nonetheless, there is a lot for people to do and see. There are many interesting shops,
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
11 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
old hotels, bookstores, art galleries, museums, a golf course, a marina, historic churches
and cemeteries, several parks, three theatres and lots of restaurants.
Because it is small, Niagara-on-the-Lake is a good place to walk around or bicycle
around. There are also horse and wagon rides. Although the main street can be hectic in
tourist season, one doesn't have to go far off the main street to get in touch with an older
slower time. Most of the downtown buildings haven't changed much since the days of
Queen Victoria, and tourists can still imagine that they are back in the days before
computers and television

Article #10
Newspapers
All the great cities in the world now have newspapers. But newspapers, as we know them
today, are not that old. The very first newspapers began long after the invention of
printing. They started in Europe in the 1600s, and were usually only a couple of pages
long. For a long time, newspapers were not very common. Governments didn't want
public discussion of their policies and decisions. Often they closed down papers, or
taxed them heavily. The "Stamp Tax" on newspapers and pamphlets was one of the
causes of the American Revolution.
Newspapers began to grow in size when they discovered advertising as a source of
income. Nowadays, advertising is the main revenue source for most newspapers. As
newspapers became more widely circulated, they could ask for more money for their
advertisements. By the late eighteenth century, newspapers were in common use in
Europe.
The 1800s and early 1900s was the golden age of newspapers. Improvements in
transportation, communication and printing processes made it easier to collect news
from near and far and to publish papers more quickly and more cheaply. The Weekly
Dispatch and the Times, both of London, England, were leading newspapers through
much of the 1800s. The Times was one of the first papers to include illustrations. It was
the first newspaper to use a steam engine to turn the presses. When the tax on
newspapers was reduced in 1836, the Times was able to increase its size considerably. In
1840, it began to use the telegraph to collect news stories. In 1855 the tax on newspapers
was finally lifted.
The Times made its greatest reputation during the Crimean War between Britain and
Russia. British armies, fighting in Russia's Crimean Peninsula, were not only
unsuccessful in the war, but were suffering severely from illnesses. The Times sent out
the world's first war correspondent, William Howard Russell, in 1854. His reports from
the battle lines had a powerful effect on the British public. A War Fund was organized to
help the soldiers. Russell forced the government to accept the offer of Florence
Nightingale to organize nurses to travel to Crimea. A photographer, Roger Fenton, sent
back photos from the war, which were published in the Times.
Meanwhile in America, a more popular approach to newspapers had developed. The
newspaper had spread west with the pioneers, and nearly every little settlement had its
own paper. American newspapers were cheaper and livelier than British ones. They were
aimed at the average person, rather than the governing class. Examples of the new style
of editing and publishing were Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst. Hearst,
especially, employed sensational and emotional writing, which aimed at stirring up the
public to action. Hearst is sometimes accused of starting the Spanish-American War of
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

1898 with his over-heated editorials. Nonetheless, his methods were successful in
raising circulation and were widely imitated.
The modern newspaper contains more than hard news. In fact, news may be a fairly small
part of it. Advertisements, gossip, show business, photos of celebrities, sports, stock
market prices, horoscopes, comic strips, weather reports and much more are found in its
pages. The modern newspaper is a total entertainment package. A question for the future
is whether electronic newspapers will replace paper newspapers.

Paul Kane, Frontier Artist
Since Christopher Columbus first met American Indians in 1492, many Europeans had
been fascinated by Indian life and culture. As a result, there was a demand in Europe for
drawings and paintings of Native Americans. European artists who had never seen an
Indian supplied most of this demand. But in the nineteenth century, several painters
traveled into Indian Territory to make an authentic record of native life. One of the first
artists to do this was the American painter George Catlin. In 1841, Catlin published a
book of his work. Catlin's work helped inspire another important frontier artist, the
Canadian Paul Kane.
Paul Kane was born in Ireland in 1810. His family moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
when Paul was nine years old. The young boy was not very interested in school. At that
time, there were still Indians living in wigwams in the Toronto area. Young Paul liked
visiting the Indian village instead of going to school.
Since Paul spent little time in school, he was largely a self-taught artist. He also became
a surprisingly good writer, considering that he had not spent much time studying
spelling or grammar. After working some years making and decorating furniture, Kane
was ready to travel. He spent the years from 1836 to 1841 living and traveling in the
United States. Then he traveled in Europe from 1841 to 1843, studying the great painters
of the past. He was back in the U.S.A. until 1845, and then he returned to Toronto.
Immediately upon his return, Kane headed into the wilderness areas around Georgian
Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, and Lake Michigan. His plan was to sketch Indian life before it
disappeared forever. American Indians were dying so rapidly from European diseases,
such as measles and smallpox, that many people believed that they would soon vanish
as a race. Their culture was threatened too. As white settlers demanded more land,
Indians were being herded into small pieces of land called "reservations." Here they
could no longer practice their traditional way of life. Kane wanted to capture Native
American life while it still existed.
Kane returned to Toronto at the end of 1845. He had received one good piece of advice
and that was if he wanted to travel into the wilderness, he would have to go with
experienced people. He was able to get the support of the Governor of the Hudson's Bay
Company, Sir George Simpson. In May 1846, Kane joined the annual canoe fleet of fur
traders going west. Kane would travel all through the wilderness areas of western
Canada and northwestern U.S.A. During this time, he made hundreds of sketches of
Indian life.
Although Kane faced incredible hardships during his travels, he was able to see what he
wanted to see. He was able to take part in one of the last great Buffalo hunts and killed
two large bison himself. Traveling west with the fur traders he visited many forts and
trading posts. He saw and painted a prairie fire. He shot a grizzly bear at close range and
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
13 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
killed several wolves that attacked his horses. He learned to travel long distances on
snowshoes in winter. Finally, he arrived at the Pacific coast, where he made some fine
drawings of the west coast Indians. European diseases had reached there just before
Kane. Fifteen hundred Indians had died near Fort Vancouver in the summer of 1848. One
wealthy chief had ruled 1,000 warriors and had ten wives, four children and eighteen
slaves. Now he had only one wife, one child and two slaves. Kane had not come too soon.
However, there were tribes still unaffected by western culture and western diseases.
Kane also traveled widely around the Columbia River in northwestern U.S.A. Everywhere
he went, he sketched Indian chiefs and scenes of native life. On his return trip, he
encountered a large war party of 1,500 braves on the warpath against their traditional
enemies. He was able to sketch the leading chief, Big Snake, who was later killed in
single combat during the battle.
When he arrived back in Toronto, Kane gave an exhibit of his sketches and watercolors.
Most of the rest of his life was spent turning these drawings into finished paintings.

Plains Indians
The best known picture of an American Indian is a warrior in buckskin, riding a horse,
wearing a headdress of eagle feathers and carrying a spear, or bow and arrow. This is a
picture of a Plains Indian, and it appears in many Hollywood westerns and on the
American five-cent piece. There were many tribes of Plains Indians; for the Northern
American prairies or plains stretch from the northern forest of western Canada down to
the States of Oklahoma and Texas in southern U.S.A.
It is interesting that our image of the Plains Indian is only true for the last couple hundred
years. It was not until the 1600s that Plains Indians began to ride horses. There were no
horses in America until Spanish soldiers brought them in the 1500s and 1600s. Some of
these horses escaped and ran wild on the prairies of America. It was these wild horses
that the Plains Indians learned to tame.
Before they had horses, the Indians hunted buffalo on foot. Buffalo were huge bison, or
wild cattle, which traveled in very large herds. A big herd might have millions of buffalo.
It was difficult to cross the prairie because these animals blocked your way.
The Plains Indians had various ways of killing buffalo. Before they had horses, Indian
hunters would quietly creep up close to the herd; then they would fire their arrows
together. There was always the danger that the herd would stampede and trample the
hunters. Another method was to drive the buffalo over a steep cliff. There are a number
of places on the plains where this was done.
Once the Plains Indians had horses, they preferred to hunt buffalo on horseback. When
the tribes started to use guns, they could kill many buffalo. Artist Paul Kane describes a
buffalo hunt in the Red River Valley in 1846. The hunters carried their bullets in their
mouths so that they could shoot faster. They would ride right into the herd, shooting at
close quarters. They would drop an article of clothes on the slain buffalo to mark it for
themselves. Then they would continue the hunt. After the hunt, the Indians would skin
the animals, and the women would dry the meat and store it in fat. A single hunt might
kill more than 30,000 buffalo.
The Plains Indians received nearly everything they needed from the buffalo. Of course,
they used buffalo meat for food. They also used the buffalo skins for clothing, blankets,
and the covering of their teepees. These teepees were cone-shaped tents, which were
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
14 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
easy to put up and take down. Plains Indians were nomadic, and followed the animals
they hunted. Since these animals were plentiful, Plains Indians usually led a comfortable
life. They developed complex religions and social rituals, as well as specialized societies
or clubs. There were also rituals and customs for hunting and warfare.
Many Plains Indians fought hard against the settlement of the Great Plains. The American
government discouraged the hunting of buffalo, because without the buffalo the Plains
Indians would not be able to fight. With the buffalo disappearing, the Plains Indians had
to give up fighting and move into government-sponsored reservations.

Article #13
Pocahontas and John Smith
In 1606, King James of England approved the establishment of two colonies along the
eastern coast of America. The northern colony in Maine lasted only a year. The southern
one at Jamestown in Virginia became England's first permanent settlement in America.
In 1607, the Virginia Company sent 104 settlers to Virginia. The settlers lived in tents all
summer. By September, more than 60 were dead because they lacked good food or water.
The leaders of the colony were not energetic and did little to make the settlers find food.
One member of the company, Captain John Smith, was determined that the colony would
survive. Smith pressured the colonists to build huts, a storehouse, and a church. He
made daring trips to Indian villages, demanding that they give the settlers food in return
for beads and copper. He threatened settlers who were trying to leave the colony and go
back to England.
On one of his trips to the interior, Indians attacked John Smith. They killed his two
companions but captured him alive. He was taken first to the local chief. This chief was
impressed by Smith's compass and spared his life. His captors dragged Smith from
village to village. He finally arrived at the town belonging to Powhatan. Powhatan was the
great chief for all of the tribes in that region. Powhatan and his advisors talked about
what to do with Smith. Suddenly, Smith was dragged forward, and his head was pushed
against a stone. The warriors raised their clubs to kill Smith. Then Pocahontas, who was
Powhatan's twelve-year-old daughter, begged for his life. Her words had no effect, so
Pocahontas ran to Smith. She took his head in her arms and laid her own head against
his head. Smith was released and went back to Jamestown.
Soon after Smith returned, one hundred new settlers from England arrived. It was a very
cold winter, and in January, Jamestown was accidentally set on fire. The settlers suffered
from cold and hunger the rest of the winter. Every four or five days, Pocahontas and her
attendants came. They brought food for the hungry settlers. Even so, half of them died.
In the summer, John Smith explored that part of the coast of America. He made a map
that would be very valuable for future sailors and settlers.
On his return, Smith was elected leader of the colony at Jamestown. However, some
settlers did not like having to follow rules. Some encouraged the Indians to try to kill
Smith. Chief Powhatan agreed. He also refused to supply food to the colony, hoping to
starve them out. Pocahontas warned Smith about the plot against his life. Smith had to
fight off several attempts to kill him. Finally, the colony seemed to be growing, and the
Indians became peaceful. But in late 1609, Smith was injured in an explosion and
returned to England.
Pocahontas remained a friend to the colony. She married John Rolfe, one of the settlers.
In 1616, she traveled to England with her husband and son. There she saw John Smith
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
15 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
once again. She was so surprised to see him that she was unable to speak for several
days. Pocahontas had believed that Smith was dead. The following year she died and
was buried in England.
Pocahontas' love for Smith, and Smith's determination to fight for the colony, had saved
Jamestown and given the English their first colony in America.
