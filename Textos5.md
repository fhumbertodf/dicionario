## 101 I Want to Dye my Hair Green

>*Many of my friends have dyed their hair different colors.  
I don't mean normal hair colors like brown or black.  
My friends have dyed their hair orange, purple and blue.
I told my mother that I would like to dye my hair green.  
I explained to my mother that I would only use food coloring.  
The green would not last forever.  
My mother said that dyeing your hair was a silly fad.  
She said that I would not look good with green hair.  
I said that if I couldn't dye my hair green, maybe I could get a nose ring.
My mother said "no."  
I said that maybe a tattoo on my arm would be nice.  
My mother said, "no way."  
My mother said that she did some crazy things when she was a young girl.  
She said that she used to iron her hair to make it straight.  
That sounds quite boring to me.  
My friend Joan came over.  
Her hair is dyed bright pink.  
My father said, "nice hair, Joan."  
I don't think that he really meant it.  
My mother says that when I am an adult I can dye my hair whatever crazy color I like, but for now she would like me to leave my hair its natural color.  
I tried to tell her that all my friends were doing it.  
My mother asked, "if all your friends were jumping off a cliff, would you do it too?"  
I said "no."  
I think I'll have to wait to have green hair, but maybe by the time I'm old enough to dye my hair green, I won't want it that color.  
My mother says that fads change all the time.  
One day something might be popular, and the next day it's not in style at all.  
I'll just have to live without green hair for now.  
I wonder what the fad will be next month.*

## 102 Why Do People Dislike Other People?

>*Some people don't like other people just because they look different.  
I think that is silly.  
I don't think that it is fair to judge someone by the way they look.  
Some people look very nice, but they are mean or cruel.
Some people look very ordinary, but they are incredibly nice.  
I remember when I was in grade one; I saw a girl across the room.  
She had a mean look on her face.  
I thought to myself that she was probably not a very nice person.  
I stayed away from her, and played with the other children.  
Then, we had to play a game, and the teacher said that she would pick partners for us.  
The teacher picked the girl with the mean face as my partner.  
I didn't think that the game would be much fun at all with a partner who seemed as mean as that girl.  
I walked up to her and said hello.  
The girl's face changed.  
She smiled at me, and she began to talk to me.  
Her mean face disappeared.  
We had lots of fun playing the game.  
We laughed a lot and enjoyed each other's company.  
That girl became my best friend.  
Now when I look at her I see what is inside her.  
Sometimes she doesn't smile, but I know what she is like.  
She is a kind and funny person.  
I have learned that you can't "judge a book by its cover."  
It is not fair to dislike someone just because they don't look like you want them to look.  
You have to get to know a person.  
It doesn't matter to me what color a person's skin is.  
It doesn't matter to me if they are short or tall, skinny or fat or happy or sad looking.  
I judge people by how they treat me, and I try to treat people like I would want to be treated.*

## 103 The Birthday Gift

>*It is going to be my father's birthday.  
What can I give him? I don't have much money.  
I have looked all through the stores, and I have not found anything that I think he would like, or that I can afford.
I have thought very hard about what to buy for him.  
I thought that he might like some candy, but my father really doesn't eat many sweets.  
I thought that he might like a new shirt, but he has lots of clothes.
I can't afford a new car or computer for him.  
I was watching him on the weekend.  
He cut the grass, washed the car, took out the garbage, weeded the garden and watered the plants.  
I got an idea.  
I went to my room and took out some paper.  
I cut out pieces of paper, and I wrote on them.  
I wrote on one piece of paper that I would wash the car every weekend for the summer.  
I wrote on another piece that I would take out the garbage every week for the summer.  
I also wrote that I would cut the grass, weed the garden and water the plants every week for the summer.  
I made a birthday card for my dad, and I put the pieces of paper inside it.  
I went downstairs and gave my gift to my dad.  
My dad thought that the gift was very thoughtful.  
He said that it was a gift from the heart.  
I did all those things for my dad all summer.  
He said that he had a lot of free time because I helped him so much.  
My dad and I are good friends.  
I don't mind doing things for him because I know that he is always there to help me out.  
A good gift doesn't have to be something that costs a lot.  
My dad says that the best gifts are the ones that show how much you care for the other person.  
I'm glad my dad liked his gift.*

## 104 New Year's Day On New Year's Day people start a new year.  

>*Many people make resolutions.  
They resolve to be better people.  
Some people decide that they will lose weight so that they can be healthier.  
Some people decide to give up smoking.
They also want to be healthier.  
There are all kinds of resolutions that people make.  
Some people try not to lose their tempers.  
Some people say that they will work harder.  
There are people who try to give up bad habits.  
Every year, my brother says that he will stop biting his nails.  
He stops biting his nails in January, but by February he always starts again.  
That is the thing about New Year's resolutions.  
People seldom keep them.  
Everybody starts out with good intentions, but it is very hard to stick with them.  
I don't make New Year's resolutions.  
I find that I just break them.  
I just work day by day to break my bad habits.  
I know that I eat too many sweets.  
Every day, I just try to resist them.  
I think that every day is a new day regardless of whether it is New Year's Day or not.
Bad habits are hard to break.  
The best thing is never to start any bad habits.  
I don't know if my brother will ever stop biting his nails, but I know that each January he intends to stop.  
Maybe one of these New Year's Days he'll get over that habit.*

## 105 If I Could Fly

>*I sometimes imagine what it would be like if I could fly like a bird.  
Just imagine what it would be like to soar into the sky, flying high above the trees.  
You could stand on high rooftops and never be afraid of falling.  
You would see so many things as you flew over rooftops and forests.  
You would feel incredibly free as you traveled from place to place, not bothered by road signs or traffic jams.  
If I could fly like a bird, I would start from my back yard and travel through town.  
I would look down on the houses and factories.  
When I got tired, I would land in a field and take a nap.  
I would travel above rivers, and follow them as they wound along and emptied into lakes and oceans.  
I would fly above parks, and I would call out to the children as I flew high above them.  
I would dip and dive as I flew.  
I would soar up high and dive down low so that I could almost touch the treetops.  
Have you ever flown? 
I know that you can't fly like a bird, but you might have taken an airplane ride.  
When you're in an airplane, you pass through clouds.  
It is exciting to take an airplane ride.  
I love taking airplane flights.  
I like to look down at the Earth.  
When you are up that high, everything below you looks tiny.  
That's the closest I'll get to flying like a bird.  
But I can still use my imagination and spread my wings and soar high above the world just like a bird.* 

## 106 What I Look for in a Friend

>*What is it that makes somebody your friend? Some people are nice, and you have fun with them.  
Some people are nice to talk to, but they don't become special to you.  
Some people become very close to you.  
Those people are the ones who become your good friends.  
Did you ever wonder why certain people do become your good friends? Friends usually have something in common.  
Often, friends enjoy doing the same things as each other.  
Maybe they like the same sports, or the same music, or maybe they can even talk about problems or schoolwork.  
Friends usually find a common bond.
Friends share ideas and listen to each other.  
Sometimes, people who don't have similar interests even become friends.  
You can learn a lot from a person who likes different things than you.  
The most important thing about friends is that they must communicate with each other.  
A good friend is a person who takes the time to listen to the other person.  
One of the most important things that I think a friend should have is a sense of humor.  
I like to laugh with my friends.  
I like to feel comfortable around my friends.  
It is nice to be able to talk and laugh with people who have similar interests.  
It is nice to share things with people and learn about their interests.  
You become a better person if you are able to learn things from others.  
Life is a journey.  
On that journey you meet many people.  
Some of those people will change your life.  
You have to choose your friends with care.  
A good friend is worth more than all the gold in the world.  
A good friend will make your journey through life more pleasant.  
Make friends along the way, and the path through life will be very rewarding.*

## 107 A Funny Thing Happened on the way to School

>*Last Friday it was very windy.  
I was walking down the street with my friend John.  
We were having a difficult time walking against the wind.  
The wind was pushing against us, and we felt the force of it pressing against us.  
We even had a hard time breathing.  
We were walking slowly.  
We watched the leaves as they danced and twirled in the wind.  
We watched a plastic bag as it flew by us.  
We saw a little boy whose baseball cap flew right off his head.  
His cap flew along the sidewalk, and he had to chase it.  
He finally caught it, and he held it in his hands tightly after he got it back.  
The trees were swaying frantically.  
Their branches swished and waved in the wild wind.  
John and I were hit by flying bits of paper and leaves.  
We laughed when a garbage can lid rolled along and hit John in the leg.  
We saw another garbage can rolling along the road as if it was alive.  
Everything was moving because of the wind.  
Then, the funniest thing happened.  
I wasn't paying any attention, and a paper bag came flying up the street toward us.  
It hit me right in the face and covered my whole face.  
At first, I didn't know what had happened.  
I was blinded.  
I couldn't see where I was going.  
I stopped and held out my hands.  
When I stopped, the bag fell off my face.  
I looked at John.
He was laughing very hard.  
He was laughing so hard that tears were rolling down his cheeks.  
He said that I looked very funny with the brown paper bag stuck to my face.  
I started to laugh too.  
We laughed about it all the way to school.  
John said that he wished he had a camera.  
He would have taken a picture of me with the bag on my face.* 

## 108 Advice

>*Sometimes my mother gives me advice.  
She tells me to save my money for a rainy day.  
She says that I should eat my vegetables if I want to be strong when I grow up.  
She says that you reap what you sow.  
I didn't know what that one meant, so I asked her.  
She said that if you are good to people, they will be good to you.  
If you do bad things, then bad things will come back to you.  
My mother is always giving me advice.  
She says that a penny saved is a penny earned.  
I am still thinking about that one.  
Some of these things are difficult to understand.  
My mother is very wise.  
She says that she has learned from her mistakes.  
She tells me that she would like me not to make mistakes, but she says that everyone does make mistakes.  
The important thing is that we learn from our mistakes.  
My mother says that nobody is perfect.  
My mother tells my sister that time is precious.  
My sister wastes time, and my mother doesn't like that.  
My mother tells me to be true to myself.  
She says that I should not follow the crowd.  
I should listen to my own conscience and do what I think is right.  
She says that it doesn't matter if you fail at something, the important thing is that you try.  
If you've done your best, then that is all that matters.  
I listen to my mother.  
I think she gives very good advice.  
My mother has a lot of common sense.  
I hope I am as wise as she is when I have children of my own.  
Sometimes I wish that she would not give me so much advice.  
I think that I know what I'm doing.  
But, in the end, I always remember what she has said, and I try to live by the standards that she has set for me.  
Take the advice that your parents give you.  
They only have your best interests at heart.*

## 109 A Trip to the Hospital

>*I have to get my tonsils out.  
I'm not really happy about it, but I'm tired of being sick and having sore throats.  
I have to go to the hospital two hours before my surgery.  
My mother will go with me.  
The nurses will take my temperature and check my blood pressure.  
They will make sure that I am ready for my operation.  
I will be dressed in a white gown, and I will be wheeled down the hall to the operating room.  
I can't have anything to eat or drink for a long time before my surgery.  
My mother will walk down the hall with me; then she will wave goodbye as they wheel me into the operating room.  
The doctor and the nurses will be busy in the operating room.  
They will be getting ready to perform my surgery.  
The doctor will say hello to me and tell me that he is going to put me to sleep.  
He will put something into my arm.  
He will tell me to count backwards from ten.  
I think that I will only say "ten, nine," and then I will be fast asleep.  
I won't be awake for the surgery.  
When I wake up, I will be surprised that the surgery is over.  
My throat will hurt, and I probably won't feel very good.  
My mother will be there with me.  
The nurses will give me a drink and try to make me comfortable.  
I won't be in the hospital overnight.  
I will go home later in the day.  
My parents will have to make sure that I have a lot to drink.  
I can't eat any hard foods or they will hurt my throat.  
I will sleep a lot, because I will not feel very well for a couple of days.  
It won't take long before I recover from my surgery.  
Sometimes, we need surgery to make us feel better.  
Hospitals can be a bit frightening, but the doctors and nurses are very nice, and their job is to make you better.*

## 110 What My Cat Did

>*One day I was sitting in a chair drinking a cup of tea.  
My cat came into the room and sat on my lap.  
She was quite content, and she sat there purring.  
My cat likes to drink water, and sometimes she drinks milk.  
I would never give her tea to drink.
Cats just don't drink tea.  
We were sitting there quietly when suddenly my cat stood up.  
She was looking at something on the floor.  
She crouched down low and got ready to pounce.  
It was a huge centipede.  
I think that centipedes are ugly.  
They have many legs, and they move very fast.
I would hate to have one crawl over me.  
I was surprised that she caught the centipede.  
She put her paw on it, and then she reached down and ate the centipede.  
The centipede must not have tasted very good.  
My cat got a funny look on her face, and she looked like she was trying to get a bad taste out of her mouth.  
I was thinking that I would be sick if I ate a centipede.  
My cat looked at me and jumped back up in my chair.  
She stuck her face in my teacup and took a big drink of tea.  
I was shocked.  
I had never seen a cat drink tea before.  
I think that the centipede must have tasted so bad that my cat just needed something to wash the taste out of her mouth Guess what? I didn't finish my tea.  
I threw it out and washed out the cup.  
My cat has never had a drink of tea since that day.  
She has also never eaten another centipede.  
If a centipede walks by, she just pretends that she doesn't see it.*

## 111 If I Was Tiny

>*Imagine what life would be like if you were two inches tall.  
You would have to be careful that nobody stepped on you.  
You would have to watch out for cats, dogs and birds.  
It would be very dangerous, but just think of the things that you could do.  
You could live in dollhouse, or even a shoebox.
You could use a bottle cap for a plate.  
You would have to wear dolls' clothes.  
A stamp would make a lovely picture to hang on your wall.  
You could hide in a mouse hole or a drawer.  
You wouldn't need much food.  
You could probably live comfortably on the crumbs that people would leave on the table.  
A thimble would make a good cup.  
If you went outside, the grass would seem like a jungle.  
An insect would be huge and frightening.  
A puddle would seem to be an ocean.  
You could cross the puddle in a paper cup and use a spoon for an oar.  
A matchbox would make a good bed with a handkerchief as a bedspread.  
You'd brush your hair with a toothbrush, but you'd never find anything small enough to brush your teeth with.  
You could take a ride on the back of a mouse.  
You wouldn't find any books that were small enough to read, but you might read the back of a pill bottle.  
You could ride in a toy car and have a soup bowl for a swimming pool.  
A leaf could be your umbrella, and a mitten would make a great sleeping bag.  
If you used your imagination, you could think up something to use for almost all your purposes.  
Being small might be fun, but then again, it would be frightening.  
I'd be afraid of my pet cat.  
I wouldn't want a book to fall on me.  
I would be afraid of being swept away by a big gust of wind.  
I think I'd rather be my size.*

## 112 Do People Have the Right to Smoke in Public?

>*My father used to smoke.  
He got very ill.  
The doctor told him that he had to quit smoking.  
My father tried for a long time to quit.  
It was very difficult for him.
Smoking is an addiction.  
After many months, my father finally gave up smoking, but he still craved a cigarette once in a while.  
He says that quitting smoking is the hardest thing that he has ever done.  
When my father did smoke, he smoked everywhere.  
He smoked in restaurants, stores and many public buildings.  
Now, you are not allowed to smoke in a lot of public places.  
When my father smoked, the rules were not so strict.  
People could smoke just about anywhere.  
It really wasn't fair to the people who didn't smoke.  
Their clothes always smelled like smoke, and they breathed in second-hand smoke.  
Some people think that second-hand smoke is actually worse for you than if you smoke yourself.  
People would smoke in their houses, and very young children would inhale the smoke that was in the air.  
Some people still smoke in their houses, and their children breathe in the smoke.  
Some restaurants have areas for smokers and nonsmokers, but usually the smoke drifts from one area to the other.  
There are some businesses that have banned smoking altogether.  
Personally, I think that smoking in public places should be completely banned.  
I don't think that I should have to breathe in another person's smoke if I choose not to smoke myself.  
It wouldn't be fair for a nonsmoker to get lung cancer because they had to be in a place where smokers were allowed to light up.  
I know that smoking is a powerful addiction and that it is very difficult to quit, but smokers should restrict their smoking to places where there is nobody else around.  
Lung cancer is an awful disease.  
Nobody should have to suffer with lung cancer.  
People should be educated about the dangers of smoking.  
Smoking should be banned in public places, but eventually I would like to believe that fewer people will smoke.  
It would be nice to live in a smoke free environment.*

## 113 If I were a Giant

>*If I were a giant, I wouldn't be able to fit in my house.  
I'd have to live in a building that had a high ceiling, but I'd probably have a hard time getting through the door.  
I'd have to make my own clothes, but where would I get a giant needle and thread to sew with? I couldn't ride in a car or a plane.  
I suppose I would just have to take giant steps to get from place to place.  
I would have to be very careful not to step on anybody or anything.  
When I talked, people would cover their ears.  
My voice would sound very loud to them.  
I wouldn't find shoes to cover my feet.  
I wouldn't find a knife and fork to eat my dinner with.  
I might have to use a rake as a fork.  
My dinner would be huge.  
What would I cook my dinner in? 
I certainly wouldn't find an oven big enough to put my dinner in.  
If I sneezed, it would be like a hurricane.  
If I fell down, it would be like an earthquake.  
I wouldn't have any friends because everyone would be too tiny for me to talk to.  
I think that being a giant would be very lonely.  
I couldn't have just one apple.  
I would have to have a lot of apples to fill me up.  
I would have to drink gallons and gallons of water to quench my thirst.  
I could never relax under a tree.  
I would be taller than all the trees.   
I don't think that being a giant would be fun.  
I won't ever make a wish to be a giant.  
I would rather be my height.  
I'm very happy the way I am.*

## 114 Superstitions

>*I am not superstitious, are you? Yesterday was Friday the thirteenth.  
Some people think that Friday the thirteenth is an unlucky day.  
I think that it is just like any other day.  
Some people believe that if a black cat crosses your path, you will have bad luck.  
I don't believe that either.  
My mother always gets upset if I open an umbrella in the house.  
She says that it is bad luck.  
She is probably right about that one because an open umbrella would take up a lot of space, and you might knock things over.  
If your left hand is itchy, you are supposed to get money.  
I have had an itchy left hand before, but I haven't received any money because of it.  
It is bad luck to walk under a ladder.  
This is probably true because you might knock somebody off the ladder, or have a can of paint fall on top of you.  
If you are acting in a play, it is bad luck if someone says "good luck" to you.  
This is very confusing.  
You are supposed to tell an actor to "break a leg." 
It doesn't mean that you want the actor to break his leg.  
It means good luck to the actor.  
Actors have a lot of superstitions that are very unusual.  
I am not superstitious.  
I don't believe in superstitions at all.  
It is just fun to learn about superstitions.  
Some of them are very old and have been passed down from generation to generation.  
I once did a project at school on superstitions.  
It was a very interesting topic, and I got a good mark for it.*

## 115 My Favorite Bedtime Story

>*Every night when I was little, my mother would read me a bedtime story.  
My favorite story was Tom's Midnight Garden.  
This was a story by Philippa Pearce.  
It was quite a long book, and it took quite a few nights for my mother to read the entire book to me.
In Tom's Midnight Garden Tom moves to the city to stay with his aunt and uncle.
He is very bored at their apartment.  
They have no children, so Tom has nothing to do.  
One night, the clock strikes thirteen times.
Tom knows that this is impossible.  
A clock can only strike up to twelve times.  
He sneaks downstairs and goes outside.
When he gets outside, there is a wonderful garden that wasn't there the day before.
The next day, Tom goes outside and finds that there is no garden.  
The garden only seems to appear at night.  
Every night, Tom slips out to this wonderful garden, and he meets some people in the garden.
He meets a girl named Hattie.  
Hattie and Tom become very good friends in this garden.  
Some very strange things happen in this book.  
There are some coincidences that keep you guessing about what is really going on.  
The surprise ending is wonderful.  
I really enjoyed Tom's Midnight Garden and I was very sad when my mother and I came to the end of the book.  
I felt that I had visited the magical garden with Tom.  
It is a book that I will remember all of my life.*

## 116 If I Found a Magic Lamp

>*If I was walking down the beach on day, and I happened to bump my toe on a magic lamp, I would pick it up and rub it.  
If it was a real magic lamp (but I don't believe that there really is a magic lamp), a genie would pop out in a cloud of smoke, and he would call me master.
He would say that he would grant me three wishes.  
I would have to think very hard about those wishes because I wouldn't want to waste them.  
I don't think I'd want millions of dollars.  
Money doesn't buy happiness, or so they say.  
I might wish for good health, because if your health isn't good you won't be able to enjoy anything.  
Some people might wish for beauty, but beauty is only skin deep.  
Some people would wish for a mansion, or a beautiful car or a big boat.  
I don't want any of those things.  
Some people would want fame.  
Some people would want talent.  
Some people would wish for happiness.  
That might be a good thing to wish for.  
Yes, maybe I'd wish for health and happiness, but what would my third wish be? I could wish for something enormous, something global.  
I could wish for world peace.  
That would be a wonderful thing if somebody could grant me that.  
Yes, that would probably be my third wish.  
It's too bad there aren't any genies inside magic lamps.  
I won't get my three wishes.  
I can still work toward getting my wishes.  
I can eat well and exercise to stay healthy.  
I can be involved with a lot of things and be with my friends to stay happy.  
I can volunteer my time to different organizations to help achieve world peace.  
I can do my fair share in my community to help others.
That's how I can get my three wishes, not through a magic lamp.  
I can only get what I want through self-determination and hard work.  
That is the key to getting your wishes fulfilled.*

## 117 Help

>*Did you ever have to call for help? Were you ever in a situation that was an emergency? 
>It is good to know what to do in case of an emergency.  
You should always know how to get in touch with the police and fire departments.  
I have read stories where very young boys or girls have called the police and saved their friend's or family member's lives because they knew just who to get hold of.  
If you see a fire, you should call the fire department.  
A lot of tragedies have been prevented because the calls have been made quickly.  
It is important that emergency vehicles arrive very quickly.  
That is why those vehicles have sirens.
When their sirens go, it means to get out of the way.  
Policemen, firemen and ambulance attendants are trained to handle very difficult situations.  
They often save peoples' lives.  
They go through a lot of training to become good at what they do.  
They never panic in emergencies.  
For your part, you should keep emergency numbers near the phone, or know what the emergency numbers are.  
Where I live, there is a special number that you call for any emergency.  
We teach that number to everyone, even very tiny children.  
It is important to remain calm if you need help.  
If you call an emergency number, you have to be able to speak clearly, and tell the person you are talking to exactly what the problem is.  
I hope you are never in an emergency situation, but it is a good idea to be prepared.*

## 118 The Peach Orchard

>*When I was very young, I lived near a peach orchard.  
Now, there is a park where the orchard used to be.  
I always remember the peach orchard because my grandmother and I used to go there and pick peaches.  
The owner of the orchard would let all the neighbors pick peaches.  
It's not the fact that I used to get many ripe, tasty peaches that I remember; it's the time that I used to spend with my grandmother that I remember.  
My grandmother was very old, but she was very healthy.  
She used to walk a lot.  
I think that is what kept her fit.  
She had a lot of energy so she liked to go to a lot of places.  
She would get a fruit basket, and then she would ask me if I wanted to go to the orchard.  
I always said yes because I enjoyed walking through the orchard on a sunny day.  
We never climbed up on a ladder to reach the peaches; we just reached for the low hanging fruit.  
My grandmother and I used to talk all the time that we were out there.  
It was nice to spend time with her.  
She told me many stories about when she was a young girl.  
We laughed and got to know each other better.  
My grandmother only visited us during the summer.  
She lived in California, and I lived in Niagara Falls, so we didn't get to spend a lot of time with each other.  
We enjoyed the hot summer days in the orchard.  
You could smell the peaches, and the bees buzzed lazily by us.  
My grandmother would point out different insects and birds to me.  
I learned a lot about nature from her.  
We would end up with a big basket of peaches.  
When we got home, my mother would wash the peaches, and often she would bake a peach pie for us.  
Nobody bakes a peach pie like my mother.
It's good to have memories like that.  
Childhood memories of time spent with my grandmother are very precious to me.  
Sometimes, it's just the simple things that you do in life that leave you with the nicest memories.*

## 119 Learning to Dance

>*I went to England with my mother.  
She used to be a singer in a band.  
We went to the hotel that she used to sing at.  
It was a big fancy hotel.  
Some of the people that she knew when she sang in the band were still there.  
They remembered my mother, and they had a good time talking to her and remembering old times.  
Many people told me that I looked like my mother.  
In the hotel, they had a fancy hall where they had ballroom dancing.  
I am not used to that kind of dancing.  
I always dance to rock music.  
A man told me that he would teach me how to dance.  
It looked very easy.  
I held one of his hands, and put my other hand on his shoulder.  
He told me exactly how to move my feet.  
I was very clumsy, and I stepped on his toes.  
He was patient with me, and he counted "one, two, three." 
I tried to waltz with him.  
I would start out pretty well, but then I would get mixed up and stand on his toes again.  
The man laughed about it.  
I told him that I wasn't a very good dancer, but he said that I was good for a beginner.  
I think he was just being polite.  
The man asked my mother to dance.  
My mother is a very good dancer.  
I didn't know that about her.  
She never stepped on the man's toes once.  
The man thanked us for dancing with him, and I thanked him for giving me dancing lessons.  
I don't think I'll ever be very good at that type of dancing.  
Each generation has a specific type of dancing.  
The way that I dance is different from the way that my mother dances.  
The way that I dance doesn't involve moving your feet too much.  
I'm not too good at fancy steps.*

## 120 Super Heroes

>*When my brother was very young, he loved super heroes.  
He collected plastic figures of all the super heroes.  
I think he had every super hero figurine that there was.
He used to tie a towel over his shoulders and run through the back yard.  
He pretended that he was rescuing people.  
One time he stood on the roof.  
He really thought that he could fly with his super hero cape on.
He would have hurt himself if he had jumped.  
My dad saw him and told him to get down.  
My dad explained to my brother that super heroes are not real.  
Real people cannot fly from rooftops.  
My brother was disappointed.  
He thought that the super heroes really existed.  
My dad explained that most super heroes were created as comic book characters.  
Somebody used their imagination to make them up, and then an artist drew them.  
My brother was not impressed.  
He said that he wanted to meet the super heroes.  
My father told him that he might meet someone dressed up as a super hero, but it wouldn't really be a super hero in the costume.  
It is hard to explain to small children that the things that they see in comic books and on television aren't really real.  
My brother still pretends that he is a super hero.  
He doesn't jump from rooftops, but he runs around and makes noises like he is flying.  
I look at him and remember when I used to do things like that.  
I'm more mature than my brother.  
I know that super heroes aren't real, but I know that he is having fun and using his imagination.*

## 121 Being a Princess

>*Sometimes, I think that I would like to be a princess.  
A princess would live in a palace and wear beautiful clothes.  
She would have servants to do chores for her, and she would probably marry a handsome prince.  
People would recognize her.  
They would wave to her as she drove by.  
It seems like it would be a lot of fun to be a princess.  
But maybe it wouldn't be so nice.  
Maybe it would be terrible to be recognized by everyone.  
Maybe a princess would feel like everyone was watching her.  
She would have to look nice every time she left the palace.  
There would always be people with cameras who wanted to take her picture.  
A princess would have no privacy.  
Even in her own palace there would be servants around, so she would never really be alone.  
If I were a princess, I would worry about security for my family.  
Sometimes, people who are in high positions are threatened by other people.  
That would be a worry.  
I'm not so sure that being a princess would be all that much fun.  
I think it might be better to be just a normal person like me.
I don't have to worry about looking wonderful all the time.  
People don't follow me around and take my picture.  
Whenever you see a picture of a princess, she is smiling.  
I wonder if she is smiling on the inside, or just smiling for the camera.*

## 122 My Worst Fear

>*I am afraid of water.  
I don't know why I am afraid.  
I have never had a bad experience in the water.  
I just never learned to swim.  
I should have done that when I was just little.  
It would be easier for me to swim now if I had started when I was young.  
I will go into the shallow water, but I start to panic when the water gets higher than my chest.  
I don't like the feeling of not being able to put my feet on the bottom of the pool or the lake.  
I don't like to get water up my nose.  
I choke and cough when that happens.  
My friends just tell me to relax and I will float, but I find it hard to relax in deep water.  
They keep telling me that if I panic I will sink.  
Most of my friends have had swimming lessons.  
Some of them are even lifeguards.  
They have tried to teach me to swim, but I think I need to go to a place where they actually teach swimming.  
It would be so nice to jump into a pool of cold water on a hot summer day.  
That would be so refreshing.  
If I go out onto a boat, I always wear a life jacket.  
I think it is wise to do that.  
Everyone should wear a life jacket on a boat.  
I would rather be safe than sorry.  
I have decided that I will overcome my fear.  
I will go and take swimming lessons.  
I have a goal.  
By this time next year, I would like to be able to swim the length of the pool without being afraid.  
It is best to face your fears and deal with them.  
I hope that I can overcome my fear of water.*

## 123 If I Live to be 100

>*I think I would like to live to be 100.  
It seems like an awfully long time to live.  
It is an entire century.  
Imagine all the changes that you would see if you lived to be 100.  
I had a neighbor who was 85.  
She used to tell me what things were like when she was a little girl.  
She told me what my town used to look like, what her clothes were like, and what her school was like.  
I used to enjoy listening to her stories.  
Everything was so different when she was young.  
Listening to her was like having history come to life.  
I used to try to imagine what life was like for her back then.  
If I was 100, and I had grandchildren and great grandchildren, I would tell them stories about my childhood.  
I would hope that I had a good memory so that I could remember everything.  
If I do want to live to be 100, I'll have to live a healthy lifestyle.  
Not too many people live to be that old.  
If I do get to be that old, I hope I'll still be mentally alert and physically agile.  
In my country, the Prime Minister sends a letter of congratulations to anyone who has their hundredth birthday.  
People who live to be 100 are very special.  
Maybe in the future with better medical care and healthier lifestyles, more people will live to be 100.  
If I live to be 100, I'll have a birthday cake, but I won't put 100 candles on the cake.  
I could never blow out 100 candles.*

## 124 What I Like Most and Least About Myself

>*I was trying to think up the best and the worst things about myself.  
I think the best thing about me is that I am very friendly.  
I have a lot of friends, and they all like me.  
I try to be good to my friends.
I don't often have arguments with people.  
I think that I am quite easy to get along with.  
The worst thing about me is that I sometimes feel sad.  
Sometimes I don't feel sad for any particular reason.  
I just get into moods where I am depressed.  
Sometimes there is a reason to be sad.  
I was sad when my pet frog died.  
I was sad when I lost my favorite baseball card.  
On those days, I'm still nice to my friends, but inside I feel like there is a heavy weight in my chest.  
I think that everyone feels sadness sometimes.  
I try to do things that make me happy whenever I get into one of my sad moods.  
Last Saturday, I felt a bit sad so I called up my friend John and asked him if he wanted to go to the movies.  
We went to a comedy.  
We laughed all the way through the movie, so that by the time the movie was over, I didn't feel sad anymore.  
My friendliness is my best trait, and my sad moods are my worst traits.  
I have to work at getting over my sad moods more quickly.  
Being sad doesn't do anyone any good.  
There is no use in feeling sorry for oneself.*

## 125 The Trunk in the Attic

>*Last month my grandmother asked me if I could help her to clean out her attic.  
I was happy that she asked me.  
My grandmother says that her attic is full of junk.  
I think that her attic is full of treasures.
I helped her to dust and vacuum the attic.  
I pulled and pushed around boxes and crates.  
I helped her to wash the floors and walls.  
My favorite thing that I did was to sort through the old trunk that she had up there.  
The trunk had a rusty latch on it.  
It was a bit difficult to open, but my grandmother got a knife and pried the latch open.  
The trunk was full of all kinds of things.  
There were lots of clothes.   
Some of the clothes had been my grandmother's.  
There was a blue velvet dress that she had worn to a dance when she and my grandfather were dating.  
It was a beautiful dress, but there were a few moth holes in it.  
There were some of my mother's old clothes.  
There was a pair of bell-bottom slacks that had bright flowers on it.  
I couldn't believe that my mother had ever worn something like that.  
There were some of my mother's old report cards.  
Some of her marks weren't very good.  
I had fun reading the report cards.  
There were photographs.  
There was a picture of my grandparents holding my mother when she was a baby.  
There was an old baseball glove that one of my uncles had owned.  
There was even one of my old dolls in there.  
One of her legs was missing.  
My grandmother said that I was rough with my dolls when I was little.  
I should have taken better care of my toys.  
There was even some old jewelry.  
I tried on some of the old clothes and jewelry.  
I told my grandmother that I liked looking through old things.  
My grandmother told me to keep whatever I wanted.  
She said that it was all junk.  
I still say that the trunk was full of treasures.*

## 126 Hot and Cold

>*I notice that whenever it is summer, people complain about the heat, but whenever it is winter, people complain about the cold.  
It seems that people are never satisfied.  
I don't like the winter.
It is usually much too cold for me.  
My teeth chatter, and my fingers turn numb whenever the weather gets cold.
It is hard for me to warm up once I start to freeze.  
I try to wear layers of clothes, but winter winds go through my clothes no matter how much I wear.  
My feet feel like they are blocks of ice on a cold January day when I walk home from school.  
I would not like to live in a place that had a cold climate all year long.  
I am not comfortable when it is too cold.  
I like the summer.  
Some people say that it is hot and sticky in the summer, but I don't mind the heat at all.  
I love to feel the warm sunshine on my skin.  
I like the freedom of not having to wear heavy coats and boots.  
I am the happiest when there is a slightly cool breeze that comes along to refresh you on a hot summer day.  
I could live in a place with a hot climate.  
I would enjoy that.  
Of course, when you are in a place with a hot climate there are more bugs than in places with cooler climates.  
I don't care for bugs.  
Where I live, it is very humid.  
The heat and moisture combine to make it uncomfortable sometimes.  
It is nicer when the heat is high, but the humidity is low.  
It would be better if I lived somewhere where it was hot, but not humid.  
That would be just perfect.*

## 127 Walk a Mile in My Shoes

>*Have you ever heard the saying "walk a mile in my shoes?" 
I think it is a very good saying.  
Do you know what it means? 
It means, that before you judge someone, you should put yourself in his or her position.  
For example, if someone was running in a race, and they did very poorly and came in last it wouldn't be fair to say, "oh, he's just a terrible runner."
You would have to look at all the circumstances that made the person lose the race.
Maybe they pulled a muscle in their leg the day before; maybe this is their very first race; maybe they are not in good form because something isn't right in their lives.  
There can be so many things that affect a person's life, performance and moods.  
If someone was very quiet at a party, you couldn't just assume that they weren't friendly.  
You don't know what is happening in their lives.  
They could be feeling ill, or they might have just had a bad experience.  
Nobody can know exactly how another person feels.  
Even if someone tells you what he or she is experiencing, you still won't fully understand what is going on inside the other person.  
Everyone perceives and feels things differently.  
To walk a mile in someone else's shoes is to try and understand things from that person's perspective.  
We are all shaped by the events that have taken place in our lives.  
No two people have gone through the exact same things.
So, before you are quick to judge someone, stop and think about what it is that they might have gone through.  
You won't always understand why people do what they do, but you can try to understand and put yourself in their position.*

## 128 If I Could Go Back in My Life

>*If I could go back in my life and do some things differently, this is what I would do:
I would not waste so many hours in front of the television set.  
I would get out and enjoy my own life, rather than watching actors in shows.  
I would be a little more considerate of other people.
I would realize that my mother has more to do than pick up after me.  
I would pay more attention in school.  
Tests are easier when you have paid attention, rather than fooling around in class.  
I would save more money rather than spend it on useless things.  
I would read more.  
Reading is enjoyable, and it opens the doors into all kinds of wonderful places both real and imagined.  
I would learn to play an instrument.  
Music is always appreciated if it is played well.  
I would eat better foods.  
I would try to stay healthy through my diet and exercise.  
I would take more pictures, and I would keep a journal.  
Memories are very precious.  
I would take the time to listen to what people have to say.  
People appreciate a good listener.  
I would take the time to enjoy each day as it comes.  
Sometimes, I am so busy looking forward to what is coming up that I don't take the time to enjoy the day that I am living in.  
That's what I would do if I could go back in my life.  
In fact, I think I'll just make a habit of doing all of those things all through my life.*

## 129 Joking

>*Joking is good.  
Jokes can be very funny.  
Jokes can also be hurtful.  
Jokes can be tasteless too.  
It is not an easy thing to find jokes that do not offend anyone.  
Some jokes make fun of different races.  
Those jokes are not funny.  
They are hurtful.  
It is not right to tell racist jokes.  
Many jokes use bad language or are about questionable subject matter.  
These jokes are also not acceptable.
Many people are highly offended by rude jokes.  
What some people find funny,
others will not.  
Comedy is a very personal thing.  
Some people like slapstick comedy.
That is the kind of comedy that the Three Stooges use.  
Some people like very subtle humor.  
Some people will laugh at just about anything.  
Sometimes, it is not appropriate to laugh, but you feel like laughing anyway.  
Did you ever see anyone fall down?
Did you feel like laughing when they fell down? 
You were probably worried that they had hurt themselves, yet the way that they fell was so funny that you felt like laughing.  
It's not funny when someone falls, but you can't help but laugh even though you try to hide it.  
Jokes and comedy differ from culture to culture.  
Many people from other countries come here and don't understand our comedy.  
Jokes and comedies are often geared toward our environment.  
Sometimes, comedians make fun of the things that we do in our everyday lives like going to the bank, or going grocery shopping.  
We can all relate to that.  
Being a comedian is not an easy job.  
Telling jokes and making people laugh is extremely difficult.  
Jokes are fun, and they are funny if they are good.  
Jokes can get you into a lot of trouble if they are inappropriate, and sometimes they're just not funny and nobody laughs.  
Here is a joke.  
Why does a cow wear a bell? - because its horns don't work Do you get it? 
Do you think it is funny? 
Well, maybe it's not that funny.  
I told you that it was difficult being a comedian.*

## 130 Drugs

>*There are two different types of drugs.  
There are legal drugs and illegal drugs.  
Legal drugs are the type of drugs that the doctor gives you when you are sick.  
Illegal drugs are the drugs that people sell on the street.  
Illegal drugs are very dangerous.  
If someone ever wants you to try any type of substance that you are not sure about, you should always say no.  
People who sell drugs on the street are criminals.  
If they get caught, they will be sent to jail.  
They sell drugs to get money.  
They don't care that people's lives are ruined from taking drugs.  
If you take illegal drugs, you can become addicted to them.
That means that you just have to have the drug no matter what.  
Some people steal from other people to get money to buy drugs.  
Drugs affect your mind.  
If you take drugs, you will not be able to think clearly.
Your marks in school will drop.  
Your memory won't be very good.  
Your personality won't be the same.  
It is very unfortunate that some people do try drugs.  
They think that it won't hurt them.  
They are wrong.  
If you are smart, you will stay away from all drugs, except for the ones that the doctor gives you.  
Drugs are just bad news.  
If you know someone who is thinking about trying drugs, tell them that their entire life could be ruined.  
In America, they had a saying.  
"Just say no to drugs." 
It is a good saying, but I think I would rather say, "I'm just too smart to take drugs."*

## 131 Divorce

>*Mary's parents just got a divorce.  
Mary is very upset.  
She thinks that her parents don't love her anymore.  
She thinks that they got a divorce because of her.  
She is wrong.  
Her parents love her just as much as they always did.  
They aren't getting divorced because of Mary.  
Sometimes, marriages just don't work out.  
It isn't really anyone's fault.  
Marriage isn't easy.  
It is hard for two people to stay together for a lifetime.  
Sometimes, people change as they get older, and they move on.  
Some people have perfectly good marriages, and they stay together for their entire lives.
Divorce doesn't happen because the parents don't love the children anymore.  
A lot of children feel that it is their fault, but it isn't their fault at all.  
Children neither cause the divorce, nor can they prevent it.  
It is up to the parents.  
Divorce isn't the end of the world.  
Children can still see both parents and stay with them.  
Life goes on.  
Sometimes children can get new stepmothers or stepfathers.  
That can be a good thing.  
You just have to be understanding, and know that your parents still love you.  
Life doesn't always go the way that we planned it, but it has its twists and turns.  
Life is an adventure.  
If your parents get a divorce, just be understanding.
Know that they love you and that this is a hard time for them.  
It is a hard time for you too, but these things have a way of working themselves out in the end.*

## 132 If my Fish Could Talk

>*I have a goldfish.  
He swims around in his bowl all day.  
He looks bored.  
I look inside the bowl and watch him.  
His mouth always moves.  
He looks like he is talking.  
I imagine what my goldfish would say if he really could talk.  
I think he would say: "Hey, I'm bored in this little bowl.  
Why don't you get me a bigger tank with more fish in it? 
I would like to have some friends to swim around with." 
I went out and bought a bigger tank for my goldfish.  
I put some plants at the bottom of the tank, and I got a miniature deep-sea diver to put at the bottom of the tank.  
I looked into the tank and imagined what my goldfish was saying.  
He seemed to be saying: "This is a nice tank.  
It's roomy in here, and you decorated it well, but I still don't have any friends to swim with." 
I went to the pet store and bought three more goldfish.  
I put them into the tank.  
All of the goldfish seemed to look at each other.  
They swam near each other and seemed to be playing games.  
I knew which one was my goldfish because he has a black spot on his fin.  
I looked at him, and imagined that he was talking again.  
He said: "This is great! I have a big new home and friends to swim with.  
These are nice goldfish that you brought home for me; thank you." 
Goldfish can't really talk.  
I know that.  
I just like to pretend that my goldfish talks.  
He seems very happy now with his nice new home, and his new friends.  
I don't think goldfish can smile either, but it looks like my goldfish has a smile on his face.*

## 133 The Best Teacher

>*I have had a lot of teachers.  
Some of them were good, and some of them were boring.  
There is one teacher whom I remember very well.
He is the best teacher that I ever had.  
His name was Mr.  
Alban.  
He was a history teacher.  
History is not my favorite subject.
I don't really enjoy history a lot.  
When I was in Mr. Alban's class, he made history seem exciting.  
He was more of an actor than a teacher.  
If he was describing a war, he would make us feel all the emotions that the soldiers and their families would have felt.  
We could almost hear the guns firing and the people shouting.  
He would paint a picture in our minds that was very vivid.  
When I had a history test in his class, I didn't have to study much.  
I would remember every word that he had said.  
I would see him doing the actions that went along with his stories.  
He was very animated.  
He would shout out orders as if he was a general, or he would speak softly and reverently when describing the death of a great hero.  
The most important thing that I learned from Mr.  
Alban was that I did really like history.  
I just thought that I didn't like it because most people had made it dull by just reading from the textbooks.  
History is not just a series of dates and dull facts.  
History is what really happened.  
History is real life.  
All the historical figures had real families and emotions.  
They weren't just fictional people.  
After I took history from Mr.  
Alban, I realized that I really did have an interest in it.  
He was my favorite teacher, and I will always be grateful to him for making me aware of just how interesting history
really is.*

## 134 Weather

>*Sometimes, I watch the weatherman on television.  
It is fascinating to watch him point to different areas of the country on the map.  
He tells us where the weather will be nice and where it will be bad.  
The weatherman is not always right.  
Weather reporting is not an exact science.  
Nothing is very exact when it comes to the weather.  
The weather department does a lot of research, but they can never be sure of exactly what will happen.  
Sometimes, it looks like it will be clear, but the wind changes direction and clouds move in.  
The weatherman can warn people if there is a chance of a hurricane or tornado.  
The weatherman can also warn people of floods.  
Sometimes, entire towns have to be evacuated because of bad weather.  
It is important to be aware of the weather.  
For example, it is not good to be caught in the middle of a field when there is going to be a thunderstorm.
You might want to take extra precautions if there is going to be a heavy snowstorm.
You would need to be in a secure place if a hurricane or tornado was predicted.  
You might want to cancel a picnic if you knew that it would rain that day.  
The weather affects us in so many ways.
Some people are really affected by dull, cloudy days.  
If there are no sunny days, they become very depressed.  
Heavy air pressure can cause some people to have headaches.  
Weather affects all of us in one way or another.  
It is always a topic of conversation.  
People often say things like "hello, it's a beautiful day today." 
Often we plan our lives and activities around the weather.  
So, if you are planning on walking home tonight, keep an eye on the sky.  
Are those rain clouds up there? 
You might need an umbrella.*

## 135 How to Avoid Catching a Cold

>*How many colds do you catch in a year? 
Most of my friends catch quite a few colds.  
They cough, sniffle and sneeze.  
They carry around tissues and blow their noses all the time.  
Their eyes water, and they have scratchy throats.
I don't get many colds.  
In fact, I can go for a whole year and never catch a cold.  
That is why I consider myself an expert on how not to catch a cold.  
I'll tell you how to avoid catching a cold.  
I think that you need to take a lot of vitamin C.  
I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.  
I drink fruit juice too.  
I also take vitamin C pills.  
Whenever I begin to feel a cold coming on, I make sure that I have taken my vitamin C pill, and I drink a lot of orange juice.  
That usually knocks the cold right out of my system.  
I make sure that I get a lot of fresh air.  
In the winter, a lot of buildings are shut up tight so that the air is stale, and people's germs circulate through the buildings.   
I get outside and breathe in fresh clean air.  
If somebody is rude enough to cough or sneeze right in front of me without covering his or her mouth, I just hold my breath for a second.  
I'm not sure if this works or not, but I don't want to breathe in anybody's cold germs.  
Many germs are passed through hands.  
It is important to wash your hands thoroughly if you touch anything in a public place.  
If I hold a banister while I am walking down the stairs, I think of all the people who have used that banister, and I make sure that I wash my hands before
I eat.  
Doorknobs also have a lot of germs on them.  
Money is another thing that is passed from hand to hand and is covered with germs.  
Sometimes, I see people stick money into their mouths.
Just think of all the germs that you would be putting into your mouth if you did that.  
If you just give it a little bit of thought, you can avoid a lot of the germs that cause colds.  
If you eat good foods and stay fit, your body will be able to fight off the germs that cause colds and other diseases.  
It is not always possible to avoid colds, but if you do catch a cold, drink plenty of fluids and get a lot of rest.*

## 136 The Future

>*I sometimes wonder what life will be like in the future.  
Life has changed so much in just the past few years.  
I'm sure that there are still big changes that are coming.
Do you think we'll still drive cars?
Maybe we'll get into computerized vehicles that we won't have to drive.  
We'll just push a few buttons, and the vehicles will take us to wherever we have to go.  
Maybe there won't be roads.  
We might just fly through space to get where we want to go.  
Instead of telephones, we'll just use our computers.  
We'll be able to see each other when we talk.  
That type of thing is already happening.  
Maybe we won't have to cook our meals.  
We might be able to push buttons to order whatever we want.  
A nice roast beef dinner, or an ice cream sundae, might just pop out of a machine.  
It would be nice to have a robot to clean the house for you.  
In the past few years, computers have been extremely important.  
People used to write to each other through the mail.  
Now, people communicate so much more frequently through E-mail.  
Most of my friends own computers.  
If we had all of these things to do the work for us, what would we do? We would still need people to program the computers.  
We could spend more time being creative, rather than doing everyday chores.  
The future holds many surprises.  
I'm sure that technology will become even more and more amazing.  
When my parents were young, they had never even seen a color television.  
Nobody owned a computer.  
It doesn't take long for things to change a lot.  
Who knows what amazing things are in store for us?*

## 137 Giving a Speech

>*I had to give a speech last week.  
I gave a speech to three hundred people.  
I had to speak in front of a group of students.  
I had to tell them about a campaign that we were having to raise money for cancer research.  
Giving a speech can be a difficult thing.
When you stand in front of a big crowd, you can get very nervous.  
Some people feel like they have weak knees.  
Their legs feel as if they are made of rubber.  
Their heart beats very hard inside of their chest.  
Their palms get sweaty.
Some people even become short of breath.  
For some people, giving a speech is their worst fear.  
When you give a speech, everyone is looking at you.  
They are waiting to hear what you have to say.  
When you have three hundred people looking at you; you have six hundred eyes that are on you.  
It is a little frightening when you think of it that way.  
Before I give a speech, I take three big breaths.  
I calm myself, and I remind myself that what I have to say is important.  
I like to be sure of what I am going to say, so I practice my speech in front of a mirror at home.  
I like to look like I am relaxed and friendly.  
They say that practice makes perfect; so the more speeches that you give, the better you will become at it.  
Whenever I have to give a speech, I imagine that the audience is just one big person.  
I look out into the audience until I find a friendly, smiling face.  
I focus on that person, and I pretend that I am just talking to them.  
I have become used to giving speeches.  
I am more relaxed now than I used to be.  
People tell me that I do not look nervous at all.  
I like to hear that.  
Sometimes I do feel a little flutter of nervousness, but I just ignore it and do the best that I can.  
Giving a speech is not as scary as it appears to be.  
Anyone can do it with a little practice.*

## 138 Moving to Another Country

>*My friend Steve moved to another country.  
He had lived in Canada all his life, and he moved to Japan.  
Life in Japan was very different for Steve than what he was used to.  
At first, Steve suffered from culture shock.  
His whole life seemed different.  
He was not used to the way of life in Japan.  
Steve was not used to the large crowds of people that walked up and down the streets in Japan.  
In his hometown in Canada, the streets were fairly quiet.  
Steve had to get used to the food.  
In Japan, the people eat a lot of fish.  
Steve had never eaten much fish before.  
Steve wanted pizza, but it was expensive in Japan.
Steve said that he had to adjust his eating habits.  
The people in Japan have different customs than we do here in Canada.  
Steve didn't want to offend anyone, so he had to learn the customs.  
He had to learn about what Japanese people considered polite and rude.  
Sometimes, in a foreign country you can do something to insult someone without even realizing that you are being rude.  
At first, Steve had trouble with the language.  
He said that the only way to really learn the language is to talk to people.  
Steve talked to a lot of people.  
He made a lot of mistakes, but people were patient with him, and they tried to help him with his Japanese.  
It wasn't long before Steve felt more comfortable in his new surroundings.  
You have to be willing to learn new customs and a new language if you move to another country.  
Steve feels very comfortable in Japan, and in Canada now.  
He is thinking about going to another country now.  
He thinks that he might like to try and live in Italy.  
I'm sure that he would get over his culture shock very fast if he moved there.  
Moving to a new country can be difficult, but if you are willing to learn, it can be a very rewarding experience.*

## 139 Look for the Beauty

>*I have learned that things don't always go the way that they were planned.  
If something doesn't happen the way that I want it to, I try to make the best of the situation.  
I always try to find something good in everything that happens.
Last year, I broke my ankle when I was walking on an icy sidewalk.  
At first, I was very upset.  
I was missing school, and there was a party that I wanted to go to.  
I couldn't do very much of anything.
My ankle was very sore.  
I stayed home, and I read a book.  
It was an excellent book, and one that I probably would not have had time to read under normal circumstances.  
My friends brought my homework to my house, and we had some really nice visits while they were here.  
I had to accept the fact that I couldn't go anywhere on my broken ankle, so I made the best of a bad situation.  
Once, I lost my way when I was out camping.  
I ended up in a very large field.  
I was afraid that nobody would find me, but I calmed myself down and took time to examine all the
interesting wildflowers in the field.  
My family did find me.  
They were surprised at how calm I was.  
I have learned that there is something valuable inside every adventure and something beautiful inside every person.
We had a new boy who came into our class.  
His clothes weren't in style, and he was not particularly handsome.  
Some of the boys and girls made fun of him.  
Sometimes, people can be really cruel.  
He seemed to handle it all right, but inside, I knew that it must hurt.  
Some of my friends and I invited him out with us.  
We found out that he had a terrific sense of humor, and he is probably one of the nicest people that I have ever met.  
He has since become one of my best friends.  
It makes me ashamed when someone that I know judges someone by how they look.  
It isn't fair to do that.  
You'll find that something good comes out of almost every situation.  
You'll find something good about almost everyone that you meet if you look hard enough.  
If something doesn't work out the way you planned it, just make the best of the situation.  
Look for the beauty in everything.*

## 140 My Doll

>*When I was an infant, I got a rag doll.  
It was a very plain, little doll, and it wore a clown outfit and a clown's hat.  
I used to take that doll to bed with me every night.  
I couldn't go to bed without my doll.  
My mother used to pretend that the doll was talking to me.  
She would make the doll dance and sing songs.  
I would talk to the doll.  
My mother would answer for the doll, but I was a baby, and I thought that the doll was actually talking to me.  
That doll was my best friend.  
I took her everywhere.  
One time I took her to a store with me, and I left her on a shelf in the store.  
We were halfway home when I realized that I didn't have my doll with me.  
I was very upset.  
My mother and I rushed back to the store.  
My doll was still there.  
I was so relieved.  
I hugged my doll, and I promised myself that I would never leave her anywhere again.  
I couldn't imagine life without that doll.  
Through the years, the doll became less important in my life.  
I had other things to do, but the doll still sat on my bed during the day, and I still took it to bed at night.  
I gave that doll a lot of love when I was little.  
In fact, I loved the doll so much that she looks tattered and torn now.  
There are parts of her face and hands that are almost worn away.  
I had a lot of other toys when I was little, but none of them were ever so important as that doll.  
I don't play with toys anymore, but that doll is still in my room.  
She sits in a special chair in the corner.
I'll always have that doll.  
No matter how worn out she is, I'll always keep her and cherish her as a part of my early childhood.*

## 141 I am Curious

>*I am curious about many things.  
I would like to find the answers to a lot of questions that I have.  
What holds the stars up in the sky?  
Why does ice form on the top of the lake when it is cold? 
Is there life on other planets?  
Why do we not fall off the face of the earth? 
How do caterpillars turn into butterflies? 
All of these things are mysteries to me.  
There are so many questions that are unanswered.  
I think I should go to the library and get a book to find out why people grow old.  
What makes a television work? 
I also want to know where electricity comes from.  
Who is the strongest person in the world? 
Who is the smartest person in the world? 
Why do some people have blonde hair, and some people have black hair? 
Why do people in different countries speak different languages? 
Why do people have to die? 
Why are no two snowflakes alike? 
What makes people fall in love? 
What makes the rivers run? 
Why does the sun rise every morning? 
How did the oceans form? 
Why did the dinosaurs vanish from the earth? 
I wonder if I'll ever find out the answers to all my questions.  
I think I'll have to study hard and stay in school to find out everything that I want to know.  
Some questions never get answered.  
It is good to be curious.  
People who are curious about things are the ones who learn a lot, and some curious people go on to invent things and make important discoveries.*

## 142 Creative People

>*Some people are just born to create.  
That's what I think.  
Some people just have the need to write stories, compose beautiful music, or paint pictures.  
Creativity seems to be inside them, and they need to let it out.  
It's good that we have people like that.  
Composers like Mozart and Chopin have given us music that is incredibly beautiful.  
It's not just the classical composers who have given us great pieces of music; there are modern composers who have written great songs also.  
Elton John is an example of someone who has composed many wonderful songs.  
Andrew Lloyd Webber has given us some very popular musicals like Cats and The Phantom of the Opera.  
There are so many talented and creative people in this world.  
When you visit an art gallery, you marvel at how artists are able to recreate realism or make up something that seems totally unreal yet beautiful.  
The American artist Norman Rockwell painted some pictures that actually looked like photographs.  
He tried to portray life as it was in America.  
Through his paintings, one can get a good sense of American life through the years.  
On the other hand, artists like Jackson Pollock did not portray realism.  
Jackson Pollock painted abstract pictures.  
His paintings are just as good as Norman Rockwell's, but they are entirely different.  
Some books that we read are classics.  
Mark Twain portrayed American life through his characters Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.  
Charles Dickens brought Victorian England to life through his books.  
Most people are familiar with his Christmas Carol where the mean and miserable Scrooge learns the true meaning of Christmas.  
People don't have to read the classics.  
There are modern writers who entertain readers through their stories.  
Stephen King has written a number of horror stories.  
Some of his books have even been made into movies.  
We are lucky to have creative people who share their gifts with us.  
If you are lucky enough to be creative, you should use your talents to create works of art that we all can share.*

The possibilities are endless.*

## 144 I Need Glasses

>*I have been having trouble seeing the blackboard.  
Everything is blurry.  
I keep getting headaches.  
I told my mother about it, and she made an appointment with the optometrist.  
I went to a place where they made me read words and letters on a chart.
Some of the words were big, and some were very small.
I tried to read everything, but sometimes I couldn't see some of the small letters.  
The optometrist would cover one of my eyes while I read the chart.  
Then, she would cover my other eye.  
She even put some drops in my eyes.
I asked the optometrist if I had passed or failed the test.  
She laughed, and said that it wasn't the kind of test that you passed or failed.  
She was just trying to find out if I needed glasses.  
I did need glasses.  
My mother and I looked around.  
There were many pairs of frames.  
I wanted something that was in style.  
I tried on many pairs of frames.
Some of them looked good on me, and some of them looked really funny on me.  
I finally chose a frame that was my favorite.  
I gave them to a lady who did some measurements.  
She told me to come back on Friday to get my glasses.
On Friday, I got my glasses.  
My friends liked them.  
They said I looked smart in my glasses.  
I wore them to school on Monday, and I was able to see the blackboard clearly.  
I didn't realize how much I hadn't been able to see.  
Now I don't get headaches anymore.  
I'm glad that I have my glasses.  
Everything is a lot clearer now.*

## 145 I am Clumsy

>*My mother says that I am clumsy.  
My father says that I am clumsy.  
I know that I am clumsy.  
I do things all the time that are clumsy.  
I fall down for no reason at all.
If there is a crack in the sidewalk, I will be sure to trip on it and fall down.  
If I carry a plate of food in the cafeteria, I almost always either drop it or bump into someone with it.  
I don't try to do these things, it just happens.  
When I drink juice, I miss my mouth and get juice all over my shirt.  
I always have something spilled on my clothes.  
Last week I opened a jar of peanut butter.  
The jar flew out of my hands and landed upside down on the floor.  
There was a big glob of peanut butter on the floor.  
Yesterday I knocked over the sugar bowl.  
There was a big sticky mess on the floor.  
I bump my head when I get into the car.  
I rip my pants on things.  
I lose my money out of my pockets.  
I step on the cat's tail.  
I always feel bad when I do that because the cat thinks I don't love her.  
I don't mean to do these things.  
I am just a clumsy person.  
My parents tell me to slow down.  
I am always in a hurry;
maybe that's why I'm so clumsy.  
Maybe it's just a stage that I am going through.  
If it is, I hope it is over soon.  
Being clumsy is no fun at all.*

## 146 Home Alone

>*I remember the first time that my parents left me home alone.  
I was very grown up, and I thought that I would be just fine.  
I was fine for a while.  
I watched television and had something to eat.
I called my friend on the phone, and we talked for a while.  
Then, I sat down to read a book.  
The house was quiet, very quiet.  
I found myself listening very carefully.
I heard a tap, tap tapping noise.  
I wondered where it was coming from.  
It seemed to be coming from the window.  
I turned out the lights so that nobody would see me, and I peeked out the window carefully.  
I was expecting to see a robber tapping at my window.  
There was nobody there.  
It was just a tree branch swaying in the breeze and tapping at my window.  
I felt silly.  
I turned on the lights and sat back down to read my book.  
A few minutes later, I heard some creaking noises.  
I listened carefully.  
Then, I heard a clunking noise.  
I think it might have been the furnace.  
Then there was a whirring noise.  
My imagination began to play tricks on me.  
I was imagining that there were all kinds of creatures in the house.  
I told myself to grow up.  
I wouldn't let my imagination run away with me.  
I was glad when my parents got home.  
I told them about all the noises that I had heard.  
My parents laughed and said that all houses make noises.  
We're usually just so busy that we don't hear all the noises that go on.  
I have stayed home alone many times now.  
I just ignore all the little creaks and noises that I hear.  
I am still alert and listen for anything suspicious, but I know that there are lots of noises that are harmless.  
That tree that taps on my window still frightens me sometimes, but I'm a lot braver now than I was the first time that I stayed home alone.*

## 147 Family

>*What does the word "family" mean to you? The easiest way to define family is to talk about who you are related to.  
Usually, there is a mom and a dad and children who are brothers and sisters.  
This would be the "core" family.  
Then there is the "extended" family which would include grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews and in-laws (people married to your brothers or sisters, husband or wife).
However, I think the word "family" has a much deeper meaning.  
The word "family" brings words to my mind like: love, support, help, kindness, fun, love, trips, closeness, love, forgiving, sharing, love, understanding, respect and love! You'll notice one word that is repeated over and over again.  
LOVE. I believe if a family has real love for one another, they will be able to overcome any problems they may have.  
Actually, they may not have too many problems if they all love and respect one another.
However, there are things that cannot be helped; like death, sickness or accidents.  
It is during those hard times that a family's love helps them to go through those experiences.  
We had quite a few children in my family.  
There were brothers and sisters which included an adopted brother and a number of foster children, too.  
I was also very fortunate that I had both my mom and dad to live with and do things like vacations together.  
We had a lot of fun and there were sometimes of tears, too.  
Above all, we love one another! Family is a wonderful thing! I am so lucky!*

## 148 My First Job

>*My first "real" job was during my last year of high school.  
I had taken classes in various business subjects.  
In that last year of high school, we could do a "co-op". 
That meant we could work part of the time instead of going to school.  
It would count as a credit towards our diploma.
The place I got a job was at a men's tailor shop.  
The owners were a very nice older German couple.  
They had two other men working for them, too.  
One of the men had had brain surgery for cancer.  
He had a big, long scar all around the top of his head.
He told me all about it.  
He was always happy and full of fun.  
I thought he was very brave! The tailor shop made suits to order.  
One of the salesmen would measure the man, and the customer would choose a fabric and style he (or his wife!) liked.  
The people in the back of the shop would then cut and sew the suit.  
The suits cost a lot of money.  
There were also suits already made that the customer could buy instead if they wished.  
They could also rent suits or tuxedos for weddings or parties.  
I worked at a little desk.  
I answered the phone, wrote letters, filed papers and did some bookkeeping.  
It was about a mile walk from my school to work.  
I passed many clothing shops.  
That wasn't good because I spent a lot of the money that I earned in those shops! I worked at the tailor shop for almost a year.  
It was a good experience and helped me get my next job with the United States Navy.  
That was fun, too!*

## 149 First Trip Away From Home

>*Today I am going to my friend's house.  
Her name is Valerie.  
This is going to be my first trip away from home, without my parents.  
My dad is driving me to Valerie's house, and I'll be staying there for two weeks.  
Her mom will drive me back home. 
It takes about l l/2 hours to get there.  
I have to pack enough clothes for play, work and church.  
I hope I'll pack the right things.  
Of course, I have to remember my toothbrush and hairbrush.
Valerie lives on a farm.  
I'll be helping her dad with milking the cows--I think! 
We'll play up in the hayloft after we have helped put the bales into the barn.  
We'll be all itchy when that job is done! 
There are a lot of things to do on a farm.  
Her mom is a good cook and will feed us well!
There is a nice pond where we can go swimming.  
I mustn't forget my bathing suit.  
I wonder if the farm dog comes into the pond, too.  
That would be funny! My dad and
mom are giving me money just in case we go shopping.  
I hope we do go shopping
because I want to buy lots of candy.  
(I won't tell my mom that!)  Oh, dear! I hear
Dad yelling, "Let's go!" I haven't even finished packing my things yet.  
I guess I
better stop writing this now and get busy fast! Bye!*

## 150 My Job

>*I work at a conservation park called Ball's Falls.  
I've only worked there for three weeks now.  
I am a Tour Guide, and I tell people the history of all the old buildings there.  
Somebody told me that one of the houses I work in is haunted.  
Now I get chills every time I walk into that house! My boss told me that the stories aren't real, but I have an active imagination!
Ball's Falls is very beautiful.  
It has two different water falls, the Upper Falls and the Lower Falls.  
There used to be tons of water cascading over them, which turned a big water wheel to grind grain.  
However, through the years the amount of water has really lessened.
I love working at Ball's Falls because I get to work outside a lot.  
I am getting a tan!
In July and August, I will be working with kids there at a day camp.  
I am getting ready now, making different crafts and thinking up fun new games to play.  
I can't wait to start working with them.  
I think that will be the best part of the summer.
I will be going to work again tomorrow.  
I usually have to work from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  
I also like the people I work with.  
They are very nice.  
Come to Ball's Falls, and I'll give you a tour!*
