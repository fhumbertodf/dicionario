Article #14
Remember The Alamo!
The first Europeans in the American Southwest were Spanish explorers and conquerors.
They were followed by religious orders that set up missions to Christianize the Indians.
One of these missions was San Antonio de Valero; it was founded in 1718 in what is now
San Antonio, Texas. Later, the mission structure became known as The Alamo.
In 1821, Moses Austin had persuaded the Spanish authorities to give him a charger to
settle 200,000 acres in Texas. The elder Austin died shortly after this. Five weeks later,
his son Stephen Austin traveled to San Antonio to have this charter confirmed by the
Spanish governor. In 1822, Austin led 150 settlers into Texas. When Austin learned
afterwards that Mexico was now independent of Spain, he journeyed to Mexico City to
have his charter reconfirmed. The Mexicans appointed Austin regional administrator for
his colony.
Texas grew rapidly. Cotton farming and cattle ranching were profitable and attracted
American settlers. By 1830, there were 16,000 Americans in Texas--four times the
Spanish-Mexican population.
Sam Houston had been a successful soldier and politician. He was a friend and
supporter of President Andrew Jackson. However, personal problems and political
difficulties led him to leave the U.S.A. for Texas.
Meanwhile, the struggle for control of Mexico had been won in 1833 by Santa Ana.
However, the independent thinking of the Texans infuriated Santa Ana. He had Stephen
Austin thrown in jail, and sent an army into Texas. Austin was released from jail in time to
organize the defense of Texas. The Mexican army was besieged inside the Alamo, and
after fierce fighting, surrendered. The Mexicans were allowed to go home.
Sam Houston was now elected the State's supreme commander. Not long after this,
Santa Ana approached Texas with an army of 6,000 men. Houston decided not to meet
Santa Ana in open battle but to wait for an advantage. He sent frontiersman Jim Bowie to
the Alamo. Bowie's orders were to leave San Antonio and destroy the Alamo.
When Bowie arrived, however, Texas volunteers were preparing the Alamo for a siege.
Bowie and his men pitched in to help. Other volunteers came. The fiery William Travis
arrived with 25 men. Then, the famous frontiersman, Davy Crockett, came with a dozen
Tennessee sharpshooters. When Santa Ana attacked, there were 183 Americans inside
the fort.
Santa Ana brought up cannon to bombard the Alamo. As the walls began to crumble,
4,000 Mexicans attacked from all four sides. The Mexicans overcame all resistance
because of their large numbers, but they suffered very heavy losses. All the American
defenders were killed.
While the battle was raging, the Texans back at the colony declared their independence
from Mexico.
Sam Houston now gathered men to fight the Mexican army. At first, he retreated while
waiting for a suitable opportunity. When Santa Ana's rapid advance left the bulk of the
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

Mexican army behind, Houston prepared to fight. Santa Ana's advance troops moved into
swampy land by the San Jacinto River. Houston's men attacked while the Mexicans were
having their midday siesta. Their battle cry was "Remember the Alamo!" The battle was
soon over. Many Mexicans were killed, but only a couple of Texans were killed. Santa Ana
was a prisoner.
Santa Ana readily agreed now to recognize Texas as an independent republic. Ninety
years later, in 1845, Texas became the 28th State of the U.S.A.

Article #15
Gribbio
St. Francis of Assisi, who lived in Italy in the early thirteenth century, was known for his
love of animals. He was the first person who celebrated the birth of Jesus by gathering
live animals around a manger. He often talked to the birds as he traveled along.
Sometimes, the birds would fly down and sit on his head, shoulders, knees and arms.
But the best-known animal story concerns St. Francis and the Wolf of Gribbio. St. Francis
was known for his humility and his unwillingness to hurt anyone. Once, when one of his
followers spoke harshly to some bandits, St. Francis told the man to run after the bandits
and apologize. In the same way, St. Francis thought of animals as his brothers and
sisters. Once when he was warned about some dangerous wolves, he replied that he had
never harmed Brother Wolf, and didn't expect the wolf to harm him.
While St. Francis was staying the hill town of Gribbio, he heard about a large, fierce wolf.
The townspeople were terrified of this wolf that had eaten both domestic animals and
humans. St. Francis decided to help the people and went out to talk to the wolf. The
people watched in horror as the wolf came running to attack St. Francis. But the saint
made the sign of the cross. Then he said to the wolf that, in the name of Jesus, it should
stop hurting people. The wolf then lay down at St. Francis' feet.
St. Francis addressed a little sermon to the wolf. He recounted all the terrible things that
the wolf had done. But he added that he wanted to make peace between the wolf and the
townspeople. The wolf nodded its head in approval.
In return for the wolf's agreement to keep the peace, St. Francis promised him that he
would arrange for the townspeople to feed him. When he asked the wolf never again to
harm any person or animal, the wolf nodded again. Then the wolf put out its paw as a
sign that it would keep its promise.
The wolf walked beside St. Francis back into Gribbio. When a crowd assembled, the saint
preached to them about how God had allowed the wolf to terrify them because of their
sins. He told them to repent, and God would forgive them. Then he spoke of the promise
that the wolf had made and what he had promised the wolf in return. The people agreed
to feed the wolf regularly, and the wolf again indicated that it would not hurt anyone.
Again, it put its paw in St. Francis' hand.
The wolf and the people kept the agreement. Two years later the wolf died. The people
remembered how it no longer hurt anyone and that not a single dog ever barked at it. The
townspeople of Gribbio lamented its death. Whenever it went through town, it had
reminded them of the virtues and holiness of St. Francis.

Summertime
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
17 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
In North America, July and August are holiday months. Most schools and colleges are
not in session then. Families look for activities to keep the children amused. Although
not all workers get a full two months of holidays, most people take a holiday in the
summer.
The summer begins with a national holiday. In Canada, July 1st is Canada Day. In the
U.S.A., July 4th is Independence Day. A lot of families are soon on the road. Some travel
to cottages by the lake. Some go sightseeing or camping. In Canada, especially, the
summers are short. So people try to make the most of them.
In much of Canada, and parts of the northern U.S.A., are woodlands dotted with lakes.
These regions of rocks, rivers, pine trees and wild animals are not usually suitable for
farming. However, they are ideal places to spend a summer holiday. They are far from the
cities. The woods are quiet and peaceful. People fish, go boating or swimming, have
barbeques outside, or play outdoor sports. Some people spend their whole summer at
the cottage. Others go for a week or two.
City people who don't have a cottage like to go to parks and swimming pools in the city.
If they are near a lake or ocean, they may go there for the day. Many museums, libraries
and art galleries have programs for children in the summer.
Swimming is probably the favorite summer sport. It feels wonderful on a very hot day to
jump into the cool water. Swimming is also excellent exercise. Besides swimming,
baseball and football are also popular in the summer. Spending an afternoon or evening
at a baseball game is a favorite summer pastime.
Summer is also a favorite time to catch up on reading. Stories of adventures and love
novels are favorite light reading.
But summer is especially a time for traveling across the country. Some people have a
camper or trailer that they can live in. Some stay in campgrounds and sleep in tents.
Others stay at hotels or motels, while others rent cottages or cabins for a week or two.
Most trips are by car. Many people visit national parks and other wildlife areas. Of course,
trips along the ocean, and the lakes are favorites. Along the Atlantic Ocean, the coasts of
New England and Canada's Maritime Provinces are especially popular. On the Pacific
coast, tourists travel from California all the way up to Alaska. Boat cruises along the
shores of British Columbia and Alaska are especially popular.
Of course, some people find it most relaxing just to stay at home. Others cannot afford to
travel. If you have an air-conditioned house, with a television, video player, CD player and
computer, then it can be very pleasant to stay at home. A lot of new movies are released
at the theatres in the summer. Air-conditioned theatres with new movies and lots of pop
and popcorn are favorite summer places.
After two months of summer activities, most people are ready to go back to school and
work. But they usually have lots of happy memories to take back with them.

Telephone Systems
When Alexander Graham Bell developed the telephone in the 1870s, it was fairly simple
to use. You talked into the mouthpiece and then held it to your ear to listen. For a century
of so, using the telephone meant either contacting the operator to dial a number, or
dialing yourself. After that, all you had to do was talk or listen.
Nowadays, the telephone has become a very complex instrument; it rivals the computer
as to the number of possible uses. Answering machines have been around for several
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
18 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
decades, but they are now being replaced by voicemail. Voicemail does away with the
need for an answering machine. Messages are stored on the system. That means that it
is possible to forward the message to someone else's phone, or transfer the call to a
more convenient phone of your own. You can also use "call pickup," so that anyone in
your group can answer another's phone.
Conference calls have become very common. This is when one person phones first one
person, then another, and keeps adding people to the telephone conversation. This can
regularly be done with up to six people. It is very useful for business discussions where
different people need to talk about the same thing. It also speeds up the process of
consensus, and allows everybody to be in on the decision or discussion.
The modern phone has many more features. If you don't want the caller to know what is
being said in your office, you can push the "mute" button. If you want to hang up without
putting the receiver down, press "goodbye." If you don't want to receive calls, just
forward them all into your voicemail.
Newer phones will indicate when you have voicemail messages. If you have trouble with
these features, an automatic voice will tell you your options. This help-system is built
into the telephone. For example, the help-voice will tell you how to set up a distribution
list, so that you can send the same voice message to a number of people. It will also tell
you how to send a message directly onto someone's voicemail. You can designate your
message to go to the top of the recipient's voicemail list. You can also program it so that
the recipient cannot forward it.
Some systems have limits on how much space can be used for individual voicemail.
There are a number of courtesies that voicemail users should follow. Your greeting on
your voicemail should be simple, polite and clear. If you are unable to take calls for any
reason, you might want to explain that in your recorded greeting. If you are on vacation,
you might want to include that information in your greeting.
Don't use voicemail as a way to avoid answering the telephone. Some people use
voicemail to screen calls; this can be annoying to someone who can never contact you
directly. Check your messages regularly and reply to them promptly. Enjoy the
telecommunications revolution!

Article #18
Texas
The state of Texas is famous for having the biggest and best of everything. Before Alaska
became a state, Texas was the largest American state. It was also famous for its huge
cattle ranches. Cotton is a major crop, but much of the wealth comes from oil and gas.
People think of Texans as being wealthy because there have been lots of cattle and oil
millionaires.
In the late nineteenth century, Texas cattlemen used to drive their herds north to Kansas.
There a train to the east shipped the cows. Eventually, the railroad came to Texas and the
great cattle drive stopped. By then, many Texans owned large ranches and were quite
wealthy.
In the twentieth century, oil has made many Texans wealthy. Oil refining has led to
chemical industries and synthetic products. Most Texans now live in cities. Many oil
companies have their headquarters in Dallas. Other large manufacturing cities are
Houston, Corpus Christi, Fort Worth and Austin, which is the Capital of Texas.
Several cities, such as San Antonio and El Paso, have a strong Spanish influence. This
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
19 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
dates back to the first Spanish visitors in the sixteenth century. The old mission at San
Antonio is famous as the Alamo, where an important battle for Texas independence was
fought.
Texas is a huge area with mountains, deserts, prairies, rivers and islands. The rugged
beauty of its grasslands and deserts attracts many tourists. For a state that is mostly dry,
Texas has a remarkable variety of wildflowers in the spring. Its animals and birds differ
from other parts of the U.S.A. Texas has the armored insect eater, the Armadillo; the swift
running bird, the Roadrunner; prairie dogs, jackrabbits, kangaroo rats, wild pigs, horned
lizards, and one hundred species of snakes! As might be expected also, it has many
beautiful kinds of cacti and other desert plants.
At its largest, Texas is more than 600 miles wide by 600 miles long. Such a large area
develops a distinct culture of its own. And Texans are widely recognized by their accent
and manner of speaking, their attitudes and interests and their sense of independence
and self-reliance.
Texas is also known for its beautiful women, who regularly win national beauty contests.
Its men have a reputation for being rugged, for not talking more than they have to and for
being straightforward and honest.
Although many people think of cowboys and Indians when they think of Texas, it is a
center for high-tech industries. The American space program has its headquarters in
Houston, and Mission Control Center is there. Texas is also an important manufacturer of
computers and other high tech products.
Oil production is still important in Texas, but it ranks third as a source of revenue behind
manufacturing and tourism. The colorful history of Texas and its wonderful scenery
contribute to a thriving tourist industry. Texas is also an important business and financial
area. Yes, even though times have changed, Texans proudly maintain that their state still
has the biggest and the best of everything.

Article #19
The Ford Pinto Case
Businessmen often complain that their profits are negatively affected by government
regulations. On the other hand, history has proven that it is necessary to regulate
business in at least one area--public safety. There is ample evidence that consideration
for the safety of the public is not always a priority in business decisions.
Back in 1912, the Titanic smashed into an iceberg, killing hundreds of people. It was
going too fast through a large collection of icebergs, while attempting to set a speed
record. Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats to accommodate the passengers.
Usually when such a tragedy occurs, the company is not found guilty. Instead, safety
regulations are enacted for future cases. In the future, ships were ordered to carry a
sufficient supply of lifeboats.
In 1978, the Ford Motor Company was indicted on the charge of homicide. This was the
first time such a charge had been brought against an American corporation. It related to
the deaths of three teenage girls who were burned up when their Ford Pinto was hit from
behind. The prosecution charged that the Ford Company knowingly manufactured a
dangerous car.
Behind this story is the pressure on Ford to produce a small car to compete with
imported vehicles. The Pinto was rushed into production in spite of warnings that the
gas tank was in a dangerous position. It would have cost Ford an additional $11.00 per
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
20 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
car to fix the problem. Ford decided not to.
Later, Ford produced a cost-benefit analysis to justify their position. Estimating that the
faulty design would cause 180 additional deaths, Ford valued these at $200,000 per
person. This cost was far less than equipping 12.5 million vehicles with $11.00 protectors.
So Ford felt that they had made the right decision.
Ford executives were acquitted on the charge of homicide. Nonetheless, Ford had to pay
out millions of dollars in out-of-court settlements. These were paid to families who had
lost relatives in Pinto accidents.
This case shows how far a company will go to protect its profits. For more than eight
years, Ford lobbied the government not to tighten safety standards on cars. As long as
the Pinto was profitable, Ford did not want to change the design. Although Ford made a
lot of money on the Pinto, their reputation was tarnished.
The Fort Pinto case is one of many which point to the need for governments to set safety
standards. No business wants to recall its products, or leave them sitting idly in a
warehouse, or expend large sums of money for upgrading and repairs. No airplane
company wants to have its planes in the hangar when they could be in the air making
money for the corporation. As a result, commercial companies are seldom motivated to
look closely at product or service safety. This is especially true today when the "bottom
line" in business is seen as a justification for every decision. For this reason,
governments have to oversee issues of public safety. Most businesses are too busy
working on profits to have much time or concern for doing so.

The Golden Man ? El Dorado
When Christopher Columbus sailed west from Spain in 1492, he was trying to reach the
Spice Islands (which today are called Indonesia). Spices were very scarce and valuable
in Europe at this time. No one knew that two vast oceans and the American continents
lay between Europe and Asia. Columbus did not find spices in America, but he did bring
home some gold trinkets. The American Indians wore these as jewellery. Gold, not spices,
was to become the biggest motive for exploration.
Expeditions into the interior of the Americas were very costly and very risky. Only by
promising the authorities huge profits could sailors and soldiers raise money for their
expeditions. They also needed to promise rich rewards in order to get followers and
crews. If a leader returned to Europe without gold and jewels, he might end up in jail. No
wonder the Spanish conquerors were always searching for gold.
At first, the Spaniards stayed around the coasts of the Caribbean Sea, but stories of gold
in the interior tempted them to explore inland. They asked the Indians where their gold
jewellery came from. The Indians would point further inland. They said that a wealthy
people lived in the high mountains that traded gold and emeralds for pearls, cotton and
shells.
The Spanish Emperor had given the rights to exploit present-day Venezuela and
Colombia to his German bankers in 1528. So Germans--Dalfinger, Federmann and
Hohermuth--led a series of expeditions into the jungles, grasslands and mountains.
Meanwhile, Spanish conquerors had found immense riches in gold and silver. Hernando
Cortes had captured the Kingdom of the Aztecs in Mexico in 1519. He had sent immense
treasures to Europe. Soon after this, Francesco Pizarro began to explore the west coast
of South America. In 1531, Pizarro invaded Peru and destroyed the Kingdom of the Incas.
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
21 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
Pizarro melted down the gold and silver treasures of the Incas, and sent gold and silver
bricks back to Spain. The rush to find more gold became very heated.
Rumours came down from the mountains of Colombia about a golden man - el hombre
Dorado. There were stories about a king so rich that he wore gold dust instead of a coat.
Colombia was the Kingdom of the Chibchas. They were a trading people who traded salt
and emeralds for gold, cotton, pearls, and shells. The actual gold did not come from their
kingdom. It was found in the mountain rivers, and brought to the Chibchas for refining
and metalwork.
Several armies converged on Chibcha territory. The first to arrive was the Spaniard
Quesada, coming up the Magdalene River from the Caribbean. He found the chief cities
of the Chibchas and seized their gold and emeralds. Shortly afterwards, one of Pizarro's
captains arrived from Peru and Ecuador. Then the German Federmann arrived from
Venezuela. Quesada gave the latecomers some gold and jewels to ease their
disappointment.
Quesada's men also found out about the Golden Man. High in the mountains was a lake
created by a meteorite. The Indians believes that the 'golden god' from the sky now lived
at the bottom of the lake. When a new leader of the tribe was elected, he was covered in
grease, and fine gold dust was blown over his body so that he appeared to be made of
gold. He was taken out to the middle of the lake on a raft. He would jump into the lake,
and stay in the water till the gold dust was washed off. It was considered an offering to
the god. Gold ornaments were also tossed in the lake. Then the king and his followers
would return to the shore. This ceremony was stopped several generations before the
Europeans arrived.
Many people were unwilling to believe that this was the whole story. They began to
search for a golden city hidden in the jungle. Many explorers perished in this search.
In their search for gold, the Spanish conquerors destroyed the great Indian civilizations
of America. Towns and villages had been ruined, thousands of people killed and
wonderful pieces of art melted down. Some Indians believed that gold must be a food
that Europeans desperately needed to stay alive. In many cases, the Europeans
destroyed the trading and social systems that had produced their wealth. When we think
about the great achievements of a few conquerors and explorers, we are also sad about
how much death and damage they caused.

Article #21
The Grand Canyon
The Grand Canyon is one of the most spectacular sights in nature. It is found in one
section of the valley of the Colorado River. The river begins its course high in the Rocky
Mountains of the State of Colorado. The river travels a total of 1,400 miles through
Colorado, Utah and Arizona and into the Gulf of California. It forms part of Arizona's
border with Nevada and California.
The Colorado River is a very swift and muddy river. It carries dirt and rocks down from
the mountains. The story is told of an old fur trader who was attacked by Indians high up
the river. His only escape was down the Colorado River in a small boat. It was a terrifying
trip through rapids and around rocks at top speed. The fur trader was found some days
later in very rough shape hundreds of miles down the river. No one would believe that he
had come so far so fast.
The Grand Canyon stretches for about 250 miles in the State of Arizona. The canyon was
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
22 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
carved out by the flow of the river itself. In places the canyon is more than a mile deep. It
stretches from four to 18 miles wide at the top. The canyon valley contains worn rocks
that rise up like a mountain range. The canyon has been worn down through many layers
of rock. The river has cut its way down through layers of sandstone, limestone and
shape to the granite bedrock. The different layers are of different colours, and the rocks
appear very beautiful, especially at sunrise and sunset.
Because the canyon is so deep, the climate changes as you go down into the valley. At
the top, the climate is typical of a mountain area, with evergreen trees. Next, you have
typical forest trees. Third, there are plants like cacti that grow in warm deserts. Finally,
there are sub-tropical plants at the valley bottom.
Tourists can ride down the narrow trails to the bottom of the valley on mules. On one
side is the rock wall of the canyon, and on the other side is a steep drop down to the
bottom. Tourists have to trust their guide, and the mule that they are riding, to get them
down safely. The trails zigzag back and forth, and the tourist going down travels much
more than a mile. Some 1,000 square miles of the area became the Grand Canyon
National Park in 1919.
Because the Colorado River is very swift and runs through dry country, several dams
have been built along it. These are designed to harness its power, save its water and
provide recreational opportunities. The best-known dam is Hoover Dam, formerly
Boulder Dam, on the Arizona-Nevada border. This impressive structure is 727 feet high,
and 1,282 feet long. Elevators are used to carry workers up and down inside the dam.
The water, which is backed up by the Hoover Dam, forms Lake Mead. Lake Mead is used
to irrigate nearby land, as well as for boating and fishing. The dam itself is a major
source of electric power for this section of the country.
Visitors to the Grand Canyon are often filled with awe by the size and beauty of the
canyon. People seem very small in comparison to the immense cliffs, valleys and the
mighty river.

The Niagara Park's Commission
Niagara Falls, Canada, became a major tourist attraction in the mid-1830s. By this time,
roads, canals and railways were able to bring people from urban centers, like New York
and Boston. However, the chance for big profits attracted dishonest businessmen. One
hotel in the 1860s was popularly known as the "Cave of the Forty Thieves."
There were many complaints from tourists about tricks that were used to get their money.
Some businessmen tried to put up fences around the Falls, so that all visitors would
have to pay them to see the Falls. In time, these complaints reached the ears of important
people. In 1873, Lord Dufferin, the Governor-General of Canada, proposed that the
government buy all the land around the Falls. On the American side, New York State
bought 412 acres around the American Rainbow Falls in 1885. In the same year, land was
bought near the Canadian Horseshoe Falls and named Queen Victoria Park. A
commission was formed to obtain control of all land along the Niagara River. This was
made easier because a narrow strip along the river was already government land.
However, the Commission wanted to preserve all the beautiful scenery along the river
and near the Falls for the general public. The first commissioner of the parks was Sir
Casimir Gzowski, a distinguished engineer of Polish birth.
Before the Queen Victoria Park Commission began to buy up land besides the Falls,
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
23 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
tourists had to pay for everything. There were no public washrooms, no drinking
fountains, and no safety barriers around the Falls. As a result, it was not uncommon for
tourists crowding close to the Falls, or hypnotized by the flow of the river, to step too
close and fall in. The commission took care of these problems and also set up parks and
picnic areas. In 1927, the Commission's name was changed to the Niagara Parks
Commission. It now supervises numerous attractions and parks from Niagara-on-the-
Lake on Lake Ontario, down to Fort Erie on Lake Erie. Each section of the 56-kilometer
stretch of Niagara Parks has its own places of interest. These are joined by the Niagara
Parkway, a road that runs the whole length of the river. Sir Winston Churchill called the
parkway, "The prettiest Sunday afternoon drive in the world."
The Niagara Parks Commission operates restaurants, parks and gardens, rides,
museums and historic houses, golf courses, native sites and gift shops. Near the Falls
are restaurants, parks, greenhouses, the "Journey Behind the Falls" and the "Maid of the
Mist" boat ride. North of the Falls, at Niagara Gorge, are the Spanish Aero Car Ride and
the Great Gorge Adventure. The Commission also operates a School of Horticulture, with
large gardens. Queenston Heights is a park commemorating one of Canada's heroes,
General Isaac Brock. In nearby Queenston are historic houses connected with two other
important Canadians, Laura Secord and William Lyon MacKenzie. The Commission also
operates two historic forts, dating from the War of 1812 - Fort George and Old Fort Erie.
The Niagara Parks Commission has played a major role in making Niagara Falls and the
Niagara River one of the leading tourist areas in the world. The Commission shows how
governments can work to make visits to natural wonders like Niagara Falls a good
experience for the general public.

Article #23
The Welland Canal
Before railways and automobiles became common, transporting goods over long
distances was a difficult chore. In early North America, roads were often bad or non-
existent. In the winter, snow and cold weather made travel difficult. Frontier farmers had
trouble selling their crops because it was hard to get them to the cities.
Often rivers and lakes were the best ways to travel. Fur traders carried their furs and
other supplies in canoes. But even large canoes were not big enough to hold a shipment
of wheat. Rapids and waterfalls meant that goods had to be taken out of the canoe and
carried to the next body of calm water.
One way to improve water transportation was to build a canal. In New York State,
Governor DeWitt Clinton had constructed the Erie Canal from the Niagara River to the
Hudson River, soon after the War of 1812.
Because relations between the United States and Canada were still not very friendly, this
was another reason to build a canal on the Canadian side. Canals could be used to move
supplies and troops during wartime. Sometimes the British government would forbid
Canadian farmers to sell food to the U.S.A. Without a canal to move their farm produce,
crops were sometimes left to rot.
A St. Catharines, Ontario, merchant named William Hamilton Merritt thought about all
these things in the 1820s. He also thought that flourmills needed a more reliable source
of water to operate.
St. Catharines is on Twelve-Mile Creek below the Niagara Escarpment. This creek runs
towards Lake Ontario. It rises above the Escarpment, which stands from 150 to 300 feet
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
24 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
high, then runs towards Lake Ontario. If Merritt could join the Twelve-Mile Creek to one of
the rivers, which ran to Lake Erie, the canal would provide transportation and waterpower.
The problem was to find a way to move boats up the escarpment.
From 1824 to 1829, Merritt and his friends hired labourers to dig away tons of dirt and
rock. Nearly all the work was done with shovels, pickaxes, horses and wagons. In places,
the ground was soft and landslides occurred. In other places, the men had to dig through
solid granite rock.
Merritt's main problem, however, was raising the money to pay for the construction. After
sinking all the money that he, his family and friends had into the canal, more was needed.
Merritt went to Toronto, New York and finally London, England to get the financial
support he needed.
The problem of getting the boats to climb the escarpment was solved by a series of 35
wooden locks. These carried a ship 327 feet upwards. The ship would enter a lock with a
small amount of water. More water would come into the lock, lifting the boat another ten
or fifteen feet. Then the ship would move into the next lock, and be lifted up again. Boats
going in the opposite direction were lowered instead of lifted.
The Welland Canal has been rebuilt three times since the first canal opened in 1829. Now
large sea-going and lake vessels cross the Niagara Peninsula from Lake Ontario to Lake
Erie. They carry grain, coal, iron ore, oil and many other bulk products. The Welland
Canal remains one of the most important commercial waterways in the world.

Wal-Mart Stores
Wal-Mart is now the world's largest retail organization. Wal-Mart employs around 1.2
million people worldwide. In 2000, Wal-Mart had sales of more than $191 billion, with
profits of $6.3 billion. Profits increased 16% from the previous year.
People have come to expect that Wal-Mart's profits will increase substantially every year.
Each year more stores are opened, and Wal-Mart expands into new countries. Wal-Mart
also enters new areas of business nearly every year. Few people know that Wal-Mart is
also a major real estate company.
Sam Walton opened his Walton's Five and Dime in Bentonville, Arkansas, in 1950. Twelve
years later he opened the first Wal-Mart in Bentonville. His business philosophy was
simple-- good prices, great selection and a friendly greeting. Walton was known for the
"Ten Foot Attitude." This means that any employee should greet any customer who is
within ten feet of them. He emphasized that it is important to speak to people before they
speak to you. Walton also believed that good deals from suppliers should be passed
along to customers. The combination of low prices and friendly service is basic to Wal-
Mart's success. That one store in Bentonville has become 4,203 stores in the U.S.A., plus
another 1,000 outside the United States.
Walton died in 1992, but his business philosophy continues to be preached at Wal-Marts.
Each store has greeters who meet the customers at the door, and deal with any special
needs they have. Having greeters gives the effect of having more service clerks than
Wal-Mart really has. Compared to some other department stores, Wal-Mart has relatively
fewer employees.
Wal-Mart also has the Wal-Mart Foundation, which sponsors numerous good causes.
Among their programs are high school scholarship, fundraising for local hospitals and
sick children, environmental concerns and community "matching grant' outreach.

So, what's not to like about Wal-Mart? The main complaint is that their business style is
extremely aggressive. Wal-Mart's attitudes towards manufacturers and suppliers are:
"You do it our way, or we won't do business with you." This puts Wal-Mart at an
advantage over smaller retailers who don't have the same retailing power. Wal-Mart has
been known to demand that its suppliers provide products at discount for Wal-Mart store
openings; levy fines for shipment errors; tell manufacturers what products, styles and
colours to make, etc. Wal-Mart expects product delivery in two days, and expects
manufacturers to cooperate with its promotional and retailing strategies. In effect, any
company that works with Wal-Mart becomes one of their employees.
Any company, which so dominates one area of the market, will have a lot of power. So far,
Wal-Mart has been successful in getting what it wants, and providing customers with
what they want.

Yellowstone National Park
The Rocky Mountains of North America are quite old. Even though they were very
volcanic millions of years ago, only a couple was still active today. In Yellowstone
National Park, however, there is a large area of land, which indicates recent volcanic
activity. This area contains hot springs, geysers and mud springs.
Hot springs, like geysers, are caused by underground water being heated by hot rocks
down in the earth. This hot water is then forced to the surface. When the surface rock is
soft or porous, then the hot water bubbles up like a spring. When the surface rock is hard,
then the hot water shoots up through any hole in the rock that it can find. These spurts of
hot water are called geysers. Yellowstone also contains mud pots or mud springs. These
happen when the hot water is turned to steam, and the steam carries mud and clay to the
surface.
Yellowstone Park is high up in the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming. Very few white people
went there until the 1860s. It is said that Indians avoided the area because they thought
that evil spirits lived there.
In 1869, three men from Montana decided to explore this remote area. They were very
impressed with its natural wonders and talked about it to others. Two other exploring
expeditions followed in the next two years. These visitors were so enthusiastic about the
beauty and majesty of Yellowstone that they asked that it be made a national park. At that
time, there was no national park system in America. Nonetheless, in 1872, the American
government agreed to set aside these lands as a public park.
Why were the early visitors to Yellowstone so impressed? First, the scenery is
spectacular. The Yellowstone River has created its own Grand Canyon through years of
eroding its rocky banks. It is the yellow colour of these canyon walls that gave
Yellowstone its name. The area has many waterfalls, including the 308-foot high Lower
Falls in the Yellowstone River. There are many beautiful lakes, and the largest is
Yellowstone Lake.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #25
Yellowstone National Park
The area is rich in wildlife. Among the mammals are black bears, grizzly bears, elk,
moose, mule deer, bison, bighorn sheep, coyotes, pronghorn antelope, beaver and
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

wolves. Birds, especially waterfowl, are common all year. These include the trumpeter
swan, blue heron, cormorants, bald eagles, osprey, pelicans, Canada geese and many
kinds of ducks. Sport fish are also plentiful.
About 80% of the forests consist of lodge pole pine, but there are many other evergreens.
Wild flowers are numerous and varied.
But the chief attractions are the geysers and hot springs. They occur in what was a very
volcanic area a million years or so ago. Here, hot molten lava from the center of the earth
has remained close to the surface of the earth. This lava heats the surface rocks, which
in turn, heats the underground water. The heated water shoots up to the surface as
geysers, or bubbles up as hot springs.
The most famous geyser is Old Faithful which shoots its plume of water 150 feet into the
air every 65 minutes or so. The eruption lasts up to five minutes. There are 200 geysers
in Yellowstone Park and about 50 of them are spectacular. Some shoot their spray over
200 feet high.
Visitors from all over the world are delighted that this region has been preserved as a
national park!

Article #26
Student Newspapers
In North America, most colleges and universities, as well as many high schools, have a
student newspaper. These newspapers focus on happenings at the school. They inform
the student population about activities on campus and often include world news, which
is relevant to student interests. In addition, there are opinion pieces by the student
editors, which reflect their views on the school and the world. Sometimes these editorials
oppose the way that the school is being run. Occasionally, school officials will try to shut
down or censor student papers, if they find their writing embarrassing or offensive. But
usually these disagreements are resolved by discussion.
At some colleges, the student newspaper is connected to a professional program in
journalism. But, most of the time, the idea behind the paper is to get students to research
the facts, debate the issues, and learn how to get their opinions expressed. If these
students go on to become professional journalists that is fine, but it is not really
expected.
You might wonder whether enough things happen at a college to fill out a weekly paper.
Yes, indeed! Schools and universities reflect the real world. There are often problems
with the budget and cuts to programs. New buildings go up, or are torn down. Policies
change; tuition goes up; classrooms become crowded; and personnel come and go.
University morale and funding often reflect government policies and social attitudes.
These tie the college to the larger world. Editorials often comment on how national and
world events affect the university.
At the same time, there are many things going on within the university. Construction
disturbs classes; offices are broken into; computers are stolen; accidents happen in the
parking lot; students die on the roads during the holidays; sports teams win or lose;
graduation takes place; students and instructors win awards; plays are put on;
distinguished visitors speak; rock bands are in concert.
Then there is always the question of student rights and responsibilities. What kinds of
student behavior are unacceptable? Should the university pay attention to student
activities off-campus? Committees meet, with student representation, to set guidelines
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
27 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
for these matters.
Another issue is who sets the agenda for the university. Corporate sponsors today are
buying exclusive rights to distribute their products on campus. Governments are
expecting universities to follow official policies in order to receive funding. Social groups
are demanding that university policies reflect their special interests.
So there is no shortage of topics for student journalists to address. Of course, they also
write about everything that young people are interested in - music, movies, computers,
sports, travel and pop culture. Student newspapers are an important training group for
democracy. They are also very interesting to read.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article #27
Canadian Colleges and Universities
Canada has about fifty accredited universities spread across ten provinces. All, except
one, are primarily government-funded. This means that there is considerable uniformity
regarding programs, administration and policy. Private colleges tend to be smaller and
are mostly based on a religious curriculum.
Most universities offer programs in the Humanities, Social Sciences and pure Sciences.
Many have additional faculties such as Education and Physical Education. Many
programs that lead directly to a position in the workplace are given at community
colleges. Community colleges differ from universities because their programs involve
job training and practical experience. For example, they might offer courses in areas
such as computer programming, journalism, photography, social work, dentistry and
nursing. Their programs are considered to be less abstract and academic than university
programs.
Many students see university as being more fun than community college. They don't
have to worry immediately about getting a job, and the social life is often better at
university. However, a university degree may be less likely to lead directly to a job.
Nowadays, university programs, which are work-related, such as business
administration, education, child studies and psychology, seem especially popular.
Universities, however, were founded mainly as liberal arts institutions. This means that
their original intent was to prepare people to be well-rounded human beings and
knowledgeable citizens. So nearly all universities have programs in literature, languages,
philosophy, culture, music, history and politics, as well as studies that are more job-
related.
A pass B.A. or B.Sc. degree in Canada is normally three full years of study after
secondary school. A bachelor degree with honours includes one more year of study. A
Master's degree is a further one or two years. A doctorate usually requires four or more
years. This is similar to the United States, except that their bachelor degree is normally
three years, and their master's degree may be up to three years.
To gain entrance to university you usually need to graduate from secondary school with
a B average. Some programs will require an A average. Tuition costs have gone up in
recent years as governments have handed over less money to colleges and universities.
More students now have to work during the school year to pay their expenses.
Attending college and university is known to be one of the most carefree periods in a
person's life. As long as you keep up with your readings and assignments, you should be
able to avoid major difficulties. Facilities for athletics, student radio and newspapers,
pubs and lounges and generally pleasant surroundings make campus life agreeable. It is
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
28 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
a good time to make friends, learn new skills and take calculated risks. Moreover,
colleges and universities are a good practical investment, as they help to prepare young
people for a changing world.

Article #28
Coffee and Donuts
"Let's go for coffee!" All over North America friends like to meet at the coffee shop. Here
people sit and talk about the day's business, news and sports, personal concerns, shop
talk, or simply gossip. Coffee shops have an informal atmosphere that encourages
conversation. You don't have to dress up either! Students drop in wearing T-shirts and
blue jeans, and sit beside businessmen wearing suits and ties. Many coffee shops are
open 24 hours a day, including Sundays and holidays. That way, people who work at
night or who have trouble sleeping can drop in at any time.
Because coffee and donuts are relatively inexpensive, people feel comfortable sitting for
a while, knowing that they are not spending a lot of money. Although coffee and donuts
are the main items sold at coffee shops, many also serve other beverages and desserts,
and sometimes a light lunch. Many patrons have a favourite kind of coffee or other drink
and will drive past other coffee shops to go to one that serves the flavour they like.
Visitors from other countries are often surprised at how roomy these coffee shops can
be. Some are as large as regular restaurants. Having a nice bit of space around them
encourages people to relax. Some people arrange regular dates and meet every day, or
every week, at the same time. For example, retired friends may get together every
weekday morning at 10:00 am. Others stop every morning at the drive-in line to get their
coffee for work. Even people who have coffee machines at home or at work like to go to
coffee shops to get a special kind of coffee or a favourite treat.
It might seem that the business owners would not make much money just selling a few
items, but in fact, many coffee shops do extremely well, especially if they are located in a
busy traffic area. Then business tends to be steady all through the day. Not only do
people come in and sit down, but there is usually a lot of take-out business as well.
People go to coffee shops not only to socialize with family and friends, but also to
discuss business or treat their employees to a snack. Others go there to read the
newspaper or a favourite magazine. Some people even go there to do work. This article
was written in a coffee shop!
Of course, people who come here usually like coffee and donuts. Coffee is the favourite
hot drink in North America, but most shops also serve tea, hot chocolate and cappuccino,
as well as some other cold beverages. Donuts are usually round, and are small deep-
fried breads with various toppings. Most donuts have a hole in the middle. Even these
"holes," which are punched out of the donut, can be sold separately, as a kind of mini-
donut.
Everywhere you go in North America, you will see coffee shops. So take half an hour to
stop in and relax. You'll enjoy the great North American "coffee break!"

David Livingstone ? Medical Missionary
During the reign of Queen Victoria (1837-1901), British people traveled around the whole
world. They charted the seas, mapped out distant countries and studied plants, animals
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
29 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
and people. They also claimed many lands for England. This kind of international travel
was made easier by improved transportation and communication. New inventions such
as steamships, trains, telegraphs and telephones made long distances seem smaller.
Of course, people had different reasons for going to distant lands. Some were
businessmen who saw economic opportunities overseas. Soldiers wanted fame and a
chance to enlarge the British Empire. Big-game hunters wanted to be the first to shoot
strange animals and bring back trophies to England. Scientists intended to study
unknown animals and plants. Missionaries planned to be the first to introduce
Christianity to faraway people.
In 1836 a young Scotsman called David Livingstone began to study medicine in Glasgow.
Livingstone intended to become a medical missionary. This means that he would be a
doctor, as well as a preacher and teacher.
Livingstone (1813-1873) came from a poor family. From an early age, he had worked 14
hours a day in a clothing factory for very little pay. But he was determined to learn. He
took his books with him to the factory and read as he worked. Then, after work, he would
go to his teacher to learn more.
Livingstone's goal was to teach faraway people about Jesus. However, unlike some
missionaries, he was also interested in science, geography and exploring. He had
planned to go to China in 1839, but because of the Opium Wars no missionaries were
being sent there. Instead, he asked to go to South Africa.
Europeans had traveled around the coasts of Africa for hundreds of years. But very few
white people had traveled inland. A missionary named Robert Moffatt who had begun a
mission at Kuruman in the interior inspired Livingstone.
Livingstone arrived in Kuruman in 1841. This was the farthest outpost of white settlement,
and no one seemed to want to go further inland. Livingstone felt that the missionaries
should go to the Africans, rather than waiting for the Africans to come to them. With a
fellow missionary he set out. When they came to an African tribe, they would talk to the
chief and ask permission to preach to his people. Livingstone would also set up a tent
and treat the people who had diseases. After a while, he would move on to the next tribe.
Once Livingstone learned the Bantu language he would talk to many Africans. But
sometimes he needed interpreters. There were many diseases, including malaria and
sleeping sickness. Livingstone suffered much of his life from river fever. He was also so
weak that he rode on the back of an ox.
Livingstone wanted to stop the slave trade. At this time, the slave trade was the most
profitable business in Africa. Livingstone hoped that if other kinds of trade were
developed, then slavery could be abolished. In order to open up trade, he wanted to find
an easy route into the center of Africa.
Livingstone kept going further into the interior. He was probably the first European to
cross the Kalahari Desert before reaching Lake Ngami in present-day Botswana. Not long
after, he traveled further inland. He explored the sources of the Zambesi and Kasai rivers
and eventually reached the west coast of Africa at Luanda, Angola.
Livingstone was being criticized for neglecting missionary work in order to explore.
Livingstone replied that he was opening up the continent for missionaries. Meanwhile, he
was becoming famous as a great explorer.
The British government commissioned him to explore the Zambesi River. They hoped
that ships could sail up the river into the interior. Unfortunately, the Zambesi had too
many rapids. However, Livingstone did find a route up the Shire River to Lake Nyassa. He
continued to struggle against the slave trade, which was now being taken over by Arabs.

Livingstone died in Africa in 1873. He was the first white man to explore Botswana,
Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and surrounding areas. He was not only a great explorer, but
also a fine doctor and a good missionary. Nowadays, the countries that Livingstone
visited are nearly all Christian--just as he hoped they would be.

Article #30
Favourite Cookies
North Americans are known for their "sweet tooth." This means that they like snacks with
lots of sugar. Americans drink a lot of coffee, tea and hot chocolate, and usually they
have something sweet with their drink. Cookies are one of America's favourite desserts.
The word "cookie" comes from a Dutch word meaning "little cake." People from Europe
brought their favourite recipes with them when they came to America. The English
brought their custom of having tea in the afternoon. Usually with their tea they would
have cakes or biscuits. Biscuits are usually hard wafers like, for example, ginger snaps.
In fact, the Italian slang word for Englishman is "cake eater."
In the early days, all cookies were homemade. But, in the late nineteenth Century,
biscuits began to be manufactured in large quantities by machine. In 1912, the National
Biscuit Company (Nabisco) in the U.S.A. introduced Oreo cookies. This cookie has a rich
cr?e vanilla filling between two crispy chocolate wafers. This product was designed to
meet the demand for an English-style biscuit. Oreos were good to dunk in a drink, to eat
whole, to eat in parts, or to use in cooking. Oreos have become both America's and the
world's favourite commercial cookie. New varieties of Oreos are added regularly to the
original product.
Although commercial biscuits like Oreos are very popular, many people prefer home-
baked ones. In fact, there is a whole line of commercial cookies called "home-style,"
which try to imitate homemade cookies. The most popular cookie in America can be
either bought in a package or baked at home. These are chocolate chip cookies.
Ruth and Kenneth Wakefield operated the Toll House Inn in Whitman, Massachusetts.
One day in 1930, Mrs. Wakefield ran out of baking chocolate for her baking cookies. She
broke up a chocolate bar and added the pieces to her cookie mix. She expected that the
chocolate bits would melt into the dough when she baked them. But they didn't. Soon
chocolate chip cookies were being made commercially by adding small chunks of
chocolate to regular chocolate cookie dough. Lots of people like to make their own by
adding commercial chocolate chips to their dough.
Now chocolate chip cookies are the most popular kind of cookie in North America. Over
seven billion are eaten annually here. Half of all the cookies baked in American homes
are chocolate chip cookies.
Experiments in baking and packaging have led to new kinds of cookies. Recently, soft
cookies have become very popular. Since they are packaged in foil, they can stay fresh
and soft for many months. It seems likely that the love of cookies will be around for a
long time.

Article #31
Florence Nightingale
It could be said that Florence Nightingale was responsible for inventing modern nursing.
Indeed, Nightingale did open up the professions to women generally. Her example and
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
31 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
influence during the mid to late nineteenth Century were an important factor in opening
doors to women.
Nightingale's own life reflects many of these changes. She was born in 1820, and was
one of two daughters of a wealthy English family. Her mother was a beautiful society lady
who had once turned down a favoured suitor because he was not wealthy enough. She
wanted both her daughters to be socially popular and to marry rich and important men.
Florence's father ensured that she had a good education. But she was frustrated
because girls and women were always under parental supervision. She felt called to a life
of action, but her family insisted that she divide her time between being with her family
and attending social functions. She was not allowed to do anything on her own.
When she was 16, Nightingale said that God spoke to her and called her to do His work.
But Florence didn't know what work she was being called to do. Years passed away while
she sat with her mother and sister, or attended dances and concerts or travelled to
Europe.
Nightingale became more angry and rebellious. She offended her family and friends by
refusing to marry several prominent men who wanted to marry her. By the time she was
24, she had decided to be a nurse.
But how did one become a nurse? At that time, the profession didn't seem promising.
The only respectable nurses were those women in religious orders that ministered to the
patient's spiritual health, but were not trained in medicine. The majority of nurses were
poor, untrained women who were suspected of being too fond of men or alcohol, or both.
In fact, one hospital preferred to hire unwed mothers as nurses because they had no
reputations to lose.
Nightingale's family was horrified by her plans. Their opposition delayed her plans but
could not stop them. In 1850 she visited a hospital in Germany for the first time. In 1853,
she was appointed superintendent of a women's nursing home in London. But, Florence
was still waiting for her true calling.
In 1855, the Times of London was printing reports from the Crimean War. France and
England were fighting Russia in the Crimean Peninsula. After one allied victory, the
wounded French soldiers were well taken care of, but the wounded English soldiers were
left to die. Back in England there was a public outcry. It was Florence's opportunity. She
was soon on her way to Istanbul, Turkey, with 38 nurses.
Scutari, Turkey, was the hospital where the British wounded were brought. This so-called
hospital was a death pit, where 42 out of every 100 men died. The army was unwilling to
listen to Miss Nightingale or to let her tend the wounded. She had to wait until conditions
became so bad that the regular medical officers were overwhelmed. As soon as the army
turned to her, she immediately went to work. She had the entire hospital cleaned, a new
kitchen set up, and a good water supply obtained. The death rate dropped to 22 out of
every 1,000. Nightingale became famous overnight.
Although her efforts in the Crimean War injured her health, she continued her work back
in London. She published a 1,000-page report on medical conditions in the British Army,
several books on nursing and her own proposals and suggestions. She also set up a
training school for nurses. Long before her death in 1910, she had seen nursing become
a well-established profession. Almost single-handedly she had helped to bring about
proper treatment of the sick and injured.

Article #32
Harriet Tubman
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
32 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
Before the American Civil War, the economy of the Southern States was based on the use
of slave labour. The social and political leaders of the Old South were the plantation
owners. Many of these owned hundreds of black slaves. The slaves were mainly used to
pick crops like cotton and tobacco.
Harriet Tubman was born in 1820 in the State of Maryland. As a girl of seven, she was
sent into the fields to work with the adult slaves. The slaves worked from sunrise to
sunset picking the crops. Often they sang songs while they worked.
Slaves were not taught to read or write. It was feared that reading and writing would help
slaves to escape the plantations. Harriet Tubman was illiterate. Later in life, when she
was in danger of being captured, she picked up a book and pretended to read it. This
fooled the bounty hunters.
When she was 15, Harriet helped another slave to escape. The overseer was so angry
with her that he hit her over the head with an iron weight. Harriet was knocked
unconscious for many days. All the rest of her life she suffered from headaches and
sudden sleeping spells.
Harriet escaped from the plantation to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Since Pennsylvania
was not a slave state, Harriet was fairly safe there. She was able to return secretly to the
plantation and bring the rest of her family to freedom.
There were already people working to bring black slaves up from the South to freedom.
These people, both white and black, used the language of the railroad. Escaped slaves
were called passengers, safe houses were called stations, and the guides were called
conductors. Harriet soon became a conductor in the Underground Railway.
In 1850, the American government passed a second Fugitive Slave Act. This put more
pressure on Northern States to return escaped slaves to the South. Because of this, the
Underground Railway went further north to Canada.
In 1793, Upper Canada (Ontario) had passed a law, bringing a gradual stop to slavery. In
1834, slavery was abolished in the whole British Empire. A lot of escaped slaves had
come to Canada before 1850, but now nearly all escaped slaves tried to go there.
Harriet Tubman rented a house in St. Catharines, Ontario. This provided a shelter for new
arrivals. Harriet made about eleven trips from Canada to the U.S.A. during these years. In
all, she brought back about 300 people.
Escaped slaves had to travel by night and suffered hardships in bad weather. They had
to hide during the day wherever they could. Harriet did not allow any passengers to turn
back. That might endanger the whole Underground Railway.
When the slave owners heard about Harriet, they offered a reward for her capture. But no
one caught her, or turned her in. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, she acted as a
spy for the Northern States. After the war, she married a black American soldier, Nelson
Davis. In 1869, a book was written about Harriet Tubman.
Black slaves knew Harriet as "Moses." The Bible tells the store of how Moses led the
people of Israel out of slavery in Egypt. He led them north to Palestine. In the same way,
Harriet Tubman delivered many of her people from slavery and led them north to freedom.

Article #33
Hernias Repaired Here
A hernia occurs when there is a tear or weakness in the muscle layers of the abdomen.
This allows the intestines to push forward into the gap. Usually the person feels some
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
33 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
discomfort, and may notice an egg-shaped swelling. In a few cases, the muscle layers
may clamp down on the protruding intestine, and cut off its oxygen supply. This can
result in death, if medical help is not readily available.
Hernias are more common in men than women, and are often related to lifting heavy
materials. Although most hernias are not a serious threat to health, they usually get
worse over time. The only cure is surgery to repair the cut, tear or weakness.
As with any surgery, time in hospital is usually required for recovery. This proved to be a
problem in Canada during World War II. Many young men were declared unfit for military
service because they had hernias. During the war, there was a shortage of doctors and
beds for hernia repair.
A Toronto doctor, Dr. Edward Shouldice, decided to address this problem. He personally
operated on seventy of these young men, using a technique of his own. This "Shouldice
Technique" allowed the patients a quicker recovery time than the usual method. It also
had a much lower rate of complications and failures.
After the war, Dr. Shouldice opened his own hernia clinic for the public. In 1953, a second
hospital was started in Thornhill, just north of Toronto, and today all surgery is done
there.
The Shouldice Hospital is located on a beautiful piece of land with a valley on one side
and a golf course on the other. The large grounds have wonderful gardens and flowering
trees. There are nature paths for patients to walk on. The building itself is not a regular
hospital, but more like a hotel or residence, where patients can play the piano, shoot pool,
play shuffleboard, or practice their putting.
The hospital now has 89 beds, and an average of 30 hernia operations are performed
daily. Since all the surgeons are specialists, their level of skill is very high, and less than
1% of operations need to be corrected. (The worldwide rate of failure is around 20%.)
For patients, the good news is that everything at the hospital is directed to repairing their
hernia, and aiding their recovery as quickly as possible. The staff encourages its patients
to walk and exercise within four or five hours of surgery. Patients usually stay on for
several more days, until they are fully recovered and ready to go home. Shouldice's best
advertisements are his satisfied customers.
Hernia patients come not only from Canada and the United States, but also from many
countries of the world to receive the best possible treatment. Shouldice remains the
most famous hospital in the world devoted entirely to the repair and treatment of hernias.

Julie Andrews
Julie Andrews, born Julia Elizabeth Wells, was born on October 1, 1935. She lived in a
small town called Walton-on-the-Thames in England, which is south of London. Her
father Ted Wells was a teacher, and mother Barbara was a pianist and piano teacher. She
also played piano for her sister's dancing school. Julie learned ballet and tap as a toddler
from her Aunt Joan Morris. By the time Julie was three, she could read and write. When
Julie was four, her parents divorced, and Barbara married Ted Andrews (a performer
during the war and an excellent tenor). He soon began giving Julie singing lessons. At
seven years of age, Julie had an unbelievable range of four octaves. She soon changed
her last name to "Andrews," the last name of her stepfather.
As she grew older, Julie became one of England's most popular performers. In early
childhood, Julie loved to play with her two younger half-brothers, but soon went on to
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
34 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
stardom. At age twelve, Julie was cast in a London play and stopped the show with her
remarkable talent. She starred in many different BBC productions during the forties.
Later, she starred in many Broadway plays such as The Boyfriend, My Fair Lady, and
Camelot. It was the latter play that Walt Disney made a special trip to New York to see,
and he decided then and there that Julie was perfect for the role of Mary Poppins in the
film of the same name. Mary Poppins was the high-spirited, magical nanny of Jane and
Michael Banks, two small British children. Julie also starred in many other films, such as
The Americanization of Emily, Hawaii, Thoroughly Modern Millie, and my personal
favourite, The Sound of Music. In this production she plays Maria, the lively governess of
Austrian Naval Captain Georg von Trapp's seven children: Liesl, Fredric, Louisa, Kurt,
Brigitta, Marta and Gretl. Another of Julie's talents is writing. Two of her best-known
books are The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles, and Mandy.
Julie also has five children. A daughter, Emma Kate Walton, from her marriage to Tony
Walton; four children from her second marriage to Blake Edwards, two of whom were
from Blake's previous marriage, Jennifer and Geoffrey; and two who were adopted from

Potato Chips and Corn Chips
The story goes that the potato chip was invented in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. in 1853. Multi-
millionaire Cornelius Vanderbilt complained to the chef that his fried potatoes were
sliced too thickly. Chef George Crum responded by slicing the potatoes paper thin and
frying them in hot oil. The potato chip became an instant success.
Many companies have made large profits on chips. The most successful brands are
associated with the Frito-Lay Company. Herman W. Lay of Nashville, Tennessee, was
selling potato chips from the back of his car in the early 1930s. He soon became a
successful distributor for a brand of potato chips, which were made in Atlanta, Georgia.
When that company ran into financial problems, Lay arranged to buy them out. It now
became H. W. Lay and Company.
Meanwhile in Texas, Elmer Doolin was trying to sell chips made from corn dough. This
was an old Mexican recipe, which Doolin had found in San Antonio, Texas. At first, these
Fritos corn chips were made in Mr. Doolin's mother's kitchen. It took a few years before
they sold very well. Mr. Doolin moved the company to Dallas and began to expand his
market. In 1945, he granted the H. W. Lay Co. the rights to make Fritos corn chip for the
American southeast. In 1961, the two companies merged to become Frito-Lay Inc. In 1965,
Frito-Lay merged with Pepsi to become PepsiCo. Inc., one of the largest snack food and
beverage companies in the world.
In 2000, Frito-Lay sold 58% of all the snack chips in the U.S.A. In Canada and the United
States, Frito-Lay products had sales of $9.9 billion. The most popular brand was Lay's
potato chips, followed by Doritos, Ruffles, Tostitos, Cheetos, and Fritos. Internationally,
Frito-Lay has 28% of the market worldwide. That amounts to $5.9 billion annually.
Why are potato chips and corn chips so popular? Well, they are versatile. You can eat
them by themselves or with a sandwich for lunch. They can replace other forms of
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

potatoes and corn. They can also come in various flavours. For example, potato chip
flavours include ketchup, salt and vinegar, barbeque, dill pickle and cheddar. Potato
chips can be thick or thin, ridged or flat, spicy or bland. Chips can be made from many
things besides potatoes. There is corn dough and tortilla dough, of course. But chips can
also be made from sweet potatoes, parsnips, taro root, peppers and other vegetables.
One caution about potato chips is that they are not a good source of nutrition. Parents
who send their children to school with a bag of potato chips for lunch need to remember
that these are just a snack. Because snack chips usually contain a lot of fat, they can
also lead to weight gain. It is better not to eat snack chips too often, and not to eat them
instead of healthier foods.
In Canada nearly $2 billion is spent on snack food every year and half of this is spent on
chips. People are always looking for new flavours to try. Spicy chips are gaining in
popularity. The snack chip industry just keeps on growing.

The Stratford Festival
The Shakespearean festival in Stratford, Ontario, is one of the greatest theatrical festivals
in the world. This is the story how this small town, which was far from any theatrical
centers, became so important for drama. For most of its history, Stratford was the county
town for the local farming region. It was also a railway center. But it was hardly known for
the arts.
An Irishman who opened an inn there founded Stratford in 1832. He called his roadhouse
"Shakespeare's Inn," after England's great dramatist. Soon the little town became known
as Stratford, after the town in England where Shakespeare was born. The local river was
likewise called the Avon after the English river.
The little town grew gradually and became the local center for government and law.
Stratford people seemed to enjoy the association with Shakespeare. Many streets were
given Shakespearean names such as Arden Park, Portia Boulevard, Romeo Street and
Viola Court. Local schools received names such as Hamlet Public School or Falstaff
School. Still, there was no attempt at Shakespearean theatre in Stratford, Ontario.
In 1913, the Canadian Pacific Railway threatened to take over the town. They proposed a
railway line running through the center of Stratford, which would have taken over much
of the town's parkland. The townspeople voted down this proposal. Instead, they
expanded the parkland along the Avon River. These parks were enhanced with gardens
and, in 1918, a pair of swans was added. These swans were an imitation of the swans on
English rivers.
In 1950, it appeared that the railway would be closing some of its workshops in Stratford.
The town was looking for ideas that might lead to new employment opportunities. This
was when one citizen, Tom Patterson, suggested that the town sponsor a drama festival.
Patterson was able to get Irish director, Tyrone Guthrie, to come to Stratford in 1952.
Guthrie agreed to head up the 1953 season. Everyone in Stratford pitched in to raise the
necessary money and prepare the stage. Since there was no time to put up a building,
the plays were staged under a huge tent. Two plays were put on during a six-week
season, and with great success. In 1957, a permanent theatre was built.
The Stratford season in 2001 runs for more than six months, from late April to early
November. There are fourteen plays in production at three different theatres. Altogether
there are 668 performances, with a total attendance of 580,000 people. About 40% of the
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
36 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
audience comes from the United States.
Tom Patterson's plan to ease unemployment in Stratford has worked well. The festival
has helped to create nearly 6,000 jobs and generate wages and salaries of $110 million
annually. In total, the festival brings about $170 million of revenue into the Stratford area.
Of course, to the audiences who come back every year, the main attraction is seeing
some of the best Shakespearean theatre in the world. The Stratford Festival Company is
Canada's leading acting company, and many of its actors have become internationally
known.

Article #37
The Two Cultures
In 1956, English writer and scientist C.P.Snow wrote an essay on "The Two Cultures." By
this, he meant that in the West there is a scientific culture and a literary culture.
Scientists do not talk very much to literary men and vice versa. Neither group seems to
know, nor want to know, very much about the other.
Snow argues that the scientific people and the literary people are moving further and
further apart. Few scientists or engineers read literature; very few writers or intellectuals
know or care anything about science.
This, Snow thinks, is a major problem in the world today. Literary culture seems to be
anti-science and anti-technology. This affects Western reluctance to train more scientists
and engineers.
The standard of living in the West, and throughout the world, depends on having
scientists and engineers. Nonetheless, relatively little effort is given to encouraging and
developing these areas of education.
Westerners, who are part of the literary culture, do not encourage or understand the
scientific revolution. As a result, they are insensitive to the desire of Third World peoples
to improve their lives through technology.
Snow talks about how the standard of living in England has improved since 1800. Snow's
grandfather did not go far in school, but did learn to read and write. Living in 1900, he
realized that he was better off than his grandfather who lived in the early 1800s. Snow's
great-great-grandfather was a farm labourer who didn't know how to read or write. Snow
feels that a similar transformation could happen even in very poor countries. It could
happen in a short time if the West supplied capital and engineers.
Snow believes that it is the industrial revolution that has transformed the West. This is
what has allowed the farm labourers to go to school and to learn employable skills. In
1800, only a small proportion of society could expect to live well. Now nearly everyone
has access to education and training. The same industrial revolution can happen in Third
World countries. It is the only way to improve the lot of the poor.
Snow agrees that most scientists and engineers do not read novels or cultivate the arts.
However, he doesn't consider this to be as dangerous as when literary people ignore
science and technology. Science and technology are too important to our standard of
living to be ignored; our education systems have to be changed to reflect our need of
them.
Snow's article was quite controversial. Not everyone agreed with him that science and
technology are being ignored by our educational system. But Snow certainly has a point
when he says that scientific people and literary people view the world differently. These
two different mindsets often lead to conflict in the workplace. Snow may be right that it is
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

too easy for literary-minded students to ignore science, and scientifically minded
students to ignore literature.

Article #38
The War That Both Sides Won
Today, the 3000 mile boundary between Canada and the United States is known as "the
longest undefended boundary in the world." But for three years in a row--1812, 1813 and
1814--U.S. armies invaded Canada. When both sides failed to win a clear victory, and the
costs of the war kept growing, the two countries decided that peace was the best policy.
On June 18, 1812, the United States declared war on Great Britain. The United States had
proclaimed their independence from Britain in 1776--36 years earlier. There were still bad
feelings between the two countries. Great Britain was not treating the United States as an
equal independent country. British ships were stopping American ships from trading with
Europe. British sailors went aboard American ships looking for deserters from the British
Navy. If an American sailor could not prove that he was an American, he was taken to
work for the British.
At the same time, the population of the United States was expanding. Americans wanted
to move west into lands held by various American Indian tribes. Some Americans felt that
Britain was encouraging the Indians to fight them and was supplying guns to the Indians.
In 1812, Canada was made up of a small number of British colonies just north of the
American border. Americans felt that it would be easy to take over Canada; then
Canadian land would provide homes for their growing population. Since Americans
outnumbered Canadians ten to one, the U.S. government thought that no one in Canada
would dare to oppose them. Moreover, Britain was fighting a terrible war in Europe
against Napoleon, the Emperor of France, and could not spare any troops to help defend
Canada.
But, in 1812, Canada had one advantage over the U.S.A.--good leadership. British
General Isaac Brock had served in Canada for ten years. He knew how to inspire both his
own soldiers and the ordinary people of Canada to fight for their country. He was a bold
and energetic leader who moved quickly to attack American positions before they could
attack him.
Brock found a valuable ally in the American Indian Chief Tecumseh. Tecumseh had been
trying to unite the scattered groups of Indians to fight together against American
expansion. He convinced the Indians that their best chance for success was to join the
British and Canadians against the Americans. Although both Brock and Tecumseh were
killed in battles, their example continued to inspire the defenders of Canada to fight
against the American invasions. Before the end of 1814, all American forces had been
driven out of Canada.
By 1814, Britain had defeated the French Emperor Napoleon. Now it was the turn of the
United States to be invaded. A large British force attacked the heart of the United States,
and burned the government buildings at Washington. Another British force attacked the
U.S.A. near the mouth of the Mississippi River, but it was defeated at the Battle of New
Orleans.
Both sides were tired of fighting by this time, and a peace treaty was signed on
December 24, 1814. This agreement restored everything to the way it had been when the
war began. Although this really meant that no one had won the war, both sides claimed
victory. The Americans felt that they had gained full recognition of their independence.
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

Britain would no longer board their ships, or encourage the Indians to fight them.
Canadians felt that they had shown Americans that they wanted to develop their own
country in their own way, separate from the United States. But the biggest result of the
war was the decision by both countries never to fight each other again.

Article #39
North American Death and Burial
Most people in North American die either in hospital or at home. When someone dies,
arrangements are made with a funeral home to get the body and prepare it for burial.
Funeral homes are private businesses. They usually handle most or all aspects of a
funeral, except for providing the burial plot. That usually has to be purchased separately.
Funeral homes may operate in many kinds of buildings. Old roomy private homes and
new modern one-level buildings are common types. When the funeral director receives
the body, his staff embalms it so it will not decay quickly and will look lifelike at the
funeral service. For one or two days before the burial, friends, relatives and
acquaintances are invited to visit the funeral home and pay their respects to the dead
person. The deceased person is usually dressed in their best clothes, and lying on their
back in a coffin. A coffin is a large wooden or metal chest designed to hold the body.
Members of the dead person's immediate family usually act as hosts for the funeral home
visitation. They greet the mourners and talk to them about the deceased. Usually, there
are happy photographs of the dead person near the coffin. Gifts of flowers also surround
the coffin. Usually the mourners are asked to sign a guest book.
The funeral service may take place at a church, if the deceased person wanted that.
Frequently, however, the service is held at a chapel at the funeral home. Attending a
funeral is considered a sign of respect, and people will often travel a long distance to
attend. Usually friends and relatives will take a day off work for the occasion. Notices are
put in the newspaper for several days before, so that people will know when to come.
A minister or priest usually conducts the funeral service. There will be hymns, prayers,
and perhaps a sermon, like a regular church service. Sometimes, the minister will speak
at length about the dead person. Sometimes, a member of the family does this.
Opportunity is allowed for other people to talk about their memories of the dead person.
At the end of the service, the coffin is wheeled out to a waiting car, called a hearse, which
drives the dead person to the burial place. The mourners go to their cars and follow the
hearse to the cemetery.
At the cemetery, a hole has already been dug to receive the coffin. Usually there is a
short ceremony at the grave. Sometimes, flowers are put on top of the coffin as it is
lowered into the grave. A handful of soil is tossed on the coffin, indicating burial. Usually
the mourners leave before the cemetery workers cover the coffin with earth. Then the
mourners may all go back to a church hall or restaurant for a meal.
A funeral can be quite costly. Even an inexpensive coffin can be several thousand dollars.
Sometimes, the deceased will be placed in an expensive rental coffin for the visitation
and funeral, but buried in a less expensive coffin. Even so, a full funeral rarely costs less
than $5,000, and usually quite a lot more. And this does not include the price of the burial
plot or the stone grave marker. Sometimes poor people are buried at government
expense.
It is traditional in North American to bury the whole body in the ground. However,
cremation is becoming more popular. The advantage of cremation is that it is less
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
39 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
expensive, uses less land, and it appeals to people who don't want an elaborate funeral.
Some people may wonder why so much attention is paid to a dead person. But funerals
are really for the living. They are a way of saying goodbye to the dead person and
receiving mutual support and encouragement from friends and family. Some funeral
homes help to organize grief counselling or support groups to grieving family members.
Usually the funeral service is performed in the Christian tradition and refers to the hope
of resurrection or rebirth from the dead that Christians believe in. It is now becoming
common for people to plan their own funeral service before they die. And usually
attempts are made to make the service appropriate to the person who died. This makes it
more satisfying and memorable for the family and friends.

Anastasia and the Russian Revoluion
The twentieth century brought many changes to traditional cultures around the world.
Some of the most radical changes occurred in the Russian Empire, which had one of the
oldest monarchies in Europe. In 1917-18 the rule of the Tsars was replaced by the world's
first communist government led by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. No one was more affected by
these changes than Anastasia, the Tsar's youngest daughter.
Between 1895 and 1901, Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra, became the parents of
four beautiful and healthy daughters - Olga, Tatiana, Marie and Anastasia. However, since
a girl could not inherit the throne of Russia, it was important for Alexandra to give birth
to a son. Finally, in 1904, the Tsar and Tsarina had a son, Aleksei.
This event, which should have made the whole family very happy, proved to be a source
of great sorrow. Aleksei was soon found to have an incurable disease. This disease,
hemophilia, meant that Aleksei regularly suffered from uncontrollable internal and
external bleeding which left him very weak. This caused anxiety for all the family,
especially his mother and father.
The Tsar and Tsarina loved their children. The girls, who didn't have to worry about
becoming rulers, led a fairly carefree existence. Anastasia and her sisters lived in a
palace with hundreds of servants. They attended many society parties with their parents.
The most elaborate parties were the grand balls, where everyone dressed in their finest
clothes and danced all through the night.
The absolute rule of the Tsar was not popular with everybody. The majority of the
population was poor peasant farmers who could barely keep themselves and their
families alive. If they moved into the city to get jobs in the factories, they had to work
long hours for very low wages, and live in slum conditions. Popular opposition forced
the Tsar in 1905 to give up some of his power to an elected parliament.
None of the girls married. They all lived a happy life together. They moved from palace to
palace, attended by their private tutors, visiting the beach, and sailing on the royal yacht.
Anastasia was the clown of the family. She didn't like schoolwork, but she enjoyed
painting and photography. Many of her photos of the royal family in happy times survive.
Soon the Tsar's problems worsened. The Empress Alexandra worried about her son and
became ill. War with Germany broke out in 1914, and the Russians suffered many defeats
and losses. In March 1917, there was popular revolution, and the Tsar was deposed.
From that time on, the royal family was prisoners. At first, they were treated kindly, but in
November, the Bolsheviks or communists gained control of the revolution. Lenin and his
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

followers hated the Tsar.
The royal family had been living in Tobolsk in Siberia. Because of fears that they might
escape, they were brought back to Ekaterinburg in the Ural region. Here, after midnight
on June 19, 1918, the entire royal family was shot by the Bolsheviks.
To some, this news was too dreadful to be believed. The thought that the Tsar's lively and
beautiful daughters had been killed was too hard to bear. Within a couple of years, a
woman who went by the name of Anna Anderson appeared in western Europe. She
claimed to be Anastasia. Some believed her story and some did not.
With the fall of the Soviet Union, it was possible to investigate the murder of the royal
family. It was also possible to prove that Anna Anderson was not the real Anastasia. After
a long search, the bodies of Anastasia and Aleksei were found. They had died with the
rest of the family. A great mystery was finally solved.

Article #41
Australian Origins
In many countries, leading families proudly trace their ancestors back to some
significant group of people. In the U..S.A., prominent individuals may boast that their
family came over on the Mayflower in 1620.
In England, ladies and gentlemen are happy to announce that their ancestors came to
Britain with William the Conqueror in 1066. In Australia, however, many leading families
are reluctant to talk about their origins. In fact, many years ago, one Australian city
burned its early records, so that no one would know who their ancestors were. The
reason for this is that Australia began its history as a British penal colony.
In eighteenth century England, there was a large gap between the rich and the poor. To
make matters worse, many farmers had been forced off their land by powerful
landowners. These homeless people wandered to the cities, where employment was
often hard to find. Frequent wars gave temporary employment to young men as soldiers
and sailors, but when the war was over, they were no better off than before.
As a result, theft was extremely common. To protect themselves, the upper classes made
theft punishable by hanging. The problem with this was that juries were often reluctant to
hang someone for stealing something small, and might declare the person "not guilty."
For example, if a man or woman stole a loaf of bread to feed their children, the jury might
just let them go. To prevent this, the courts came up with a new category of punishment--
exile or "transportation." If the judge or jury was reluctant to sentence the accused to
death, they would ship them far away from England across the seas. However, if the
person was found back in England again, he or she would be hanged.
At first, England sent its convicts to America's Thirteen Colonies. However, when the
United States declared its independence in 1776, this was no longer possible. England
considered sending criminals to West Africa, but the land and climate were considered
unsuitable. So finally Great Britain decided to use the huge, almost uninhabited, country
of Australia. At this time, not a single European was living anywhere on the continent.
In the fall of 1786, a fleet of English ships began to take convicts on board. This process
continued till the sailing date of May 13, 1787. Many British jails had been cleared of both
male and female prisoners.
Since the convicts were technically under a sentence of death, there was little concern
for making them comfortable. At first, the convicts were chained below decks, but later
some were released when well out to sea. One man had been sentenced for the theft of a
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
41 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
winter coat; another for stealing cucumbers from a garden; a third for carrying off a
sheep. Among the women, one was guilty of stealing a large cheese; another of taking
several yards of cloth.
These ships known as "The First Fleet" carried 1,442 convicts, sailors, marines and
officers. The fleet finally arrived at Botany Bay on January 10, 1788. Later that month,
they moved down to Sydney Harbour. No preparations whatsoever had been made. The
forests came right up to the shore. Soon, the fleet members were cutting down trees and
trying to put up tents. It was June 1790 before further supplies arrived from England.
Meanwhile, many convicts suffered from sickness, aggravated by lack of good food.
In conclusion, Australians need not be ashamed of their origins. In time, great things
were achieved, in spite of the almost complete lack of help from the English government.
Many ex- convicts became respectable settlers who began prosperous farms and
businesses. The members of the First Fleet, whether convicts or not, deserve to be
honoured as the founders of Australia.

Casa Loma
Many people visit Europe and see the old castles left from the days of knighthood. Very
few return home with plans to build their own castle. Toronto businessman Henry Pellatt
actually built such a castle - Casa Loma.
Pellatt was born in Kingston, Ontario in 1859, but the family soon moved to Toronto. His
father opened Toronto's first stock broking firm in 1866. Pellatt Sr. became part of
Toronto's financial elite. And Henry Pellatt eventually joined his father in business.
The young Pellatt was especially attracted by the military and the British armed forces.
When Henry was 18, he joined the Queen's Own Rifles, a militia unit. He was soon one of
the soldiers sent to suppress a railway strike. At 21, he was made an officer, and
gradually moved up through the ranks, eventually becoming brigadier general.
Meanwhile, Henry was learning the stock broking business. He soon showed
considerable ability at forming new companies. Electricity was a recent invention, and
Pellatt hoped to be among the foremost developers. In 1883, he founded the Toronto
Electric Light Company, and later was an owner of the Toronto Electric Railway. He also
made money as a land speculator in the Canadian West. Unlike many businessmen of the
time, however, Pellatt believed in community service. He sponsored many charitable
organizations and supported various good causes.
In spite of his business dealings, Pellatt found time to tour England and Europe regularly.
He brought back ideas for a "castle on the hill." Pellatt's castle, however, would not be a
damp, drafty castle of the Middle Ages. It would have all the latest technology.
Construction of "Casa Loma" began in 1910 and was completed in 1914. Outwardly, it
looked like a mediaeval castle, but inside it was comfortable and luxurious. There were
98 rooms, three bowling alleys, 30 bathrooms, 25 fireplaces and 5,000 electric lights. It
had an electric elevator and an indoor swimming pool. There was a library of 100,000
books, a temperature-controlled wine cellar, a shooting gallery, and a large art collection.
Pellatt ordered only the most expensive materials and employed the best craftsmen. The
cost of all this was $3.5 million, a huge sum in those days.
Pellatt and his wife liked to entertain. They often opened up Casa Loma for special events.
Sometimes, he would invite all 1,000 men from the Queen's Own Rifles over for the
weekend. The Pellatts also held parties for the staff.
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

Pellatt had hoped that Casa Loma would be the center of an extensive subdivision. He
hoped that wealthy people would build grand homes nearby, and so he had bought up
land near his castle. Unfortunately for Pellatt, most of the people coming to Toronto were
poor immigrants who couldn't afford large houses. Pellatt was unable to sell his land
holdings, and his income declined. In 1924, Pellatt turned Casa Loma over to the City of
Toronto because he could not pay his property tax.
All the contents of Casa Loma went on auction soon after. His $1.5 million collection of
art and artifacts sold for only $250,000. Now Casa Loma is a leading Toronto tourist
attraction. "The castle in the middle of the city" has 400,000 visitors each year. It is the
closest thing in North America to a real European castle.

Article #43
Charlie Brown
On October 2, 1950, a new comic strip appeared in American newspapers. The "hero" of
the strip was a round-headed kid named Charlie Brown. In the very first cartoon, two
young schoolmates watch Charlie Brown walking by, and one comments, "Well! Here
comes ol' Charlie Brown.Yes, Sir! Good ol' Charlie Brown. How I hate him!"
This comic strip was to become one of the most popular in history. Its creator, Charles M.
Schultz, drew the strip for 50 years until his death. But reruns of "Peanuts" still appear
regularly in the newspaper. What are some of the characteristics of Charlie Brown and
his friends that have made the cartoon popular?
Charlie Brown is an unlikely hero. Other kids don't like being around him because the
things he does never seem to work out properly. Kids want to be with someone who is
good-looking, popular and successful, so that they can feel a part of his success. Charlie
Brown is always worrying, hardly ever up-beat, afraid of failure, and always making
mistakes. His kite gets snagged in a tree, he needs counseling from Lucy, his dog
Snoopy is more popular than he is, and the little red-haired girl never notices him. In
short, Charlie Brown is a "loser."
Charlie Brown illustrates all the insecurities that kids have. Many of these anxieties carry
over into adult life. Sometimes, they reflect problems in the life of the comic strip's
creator, Charles M. Schulz. Schulz suffered from depression much of his life and had a
difficult time in school. He was not very popular with his classmates. Humour and
laughter are often a way of dealing with problems. And in the "Peanuts" strip, the world
can laugh at all the silly little things that people do.
Because of its honest way of dealing with problems, Charlie Brown and his friends are
more interesting than the average comic strip characters. The characters represent adult
personality types. Charlie Brown is "wishy-washy," and is afraid to do things for fear of
failure. Lucy is a pushy overbearing female, who thinks she knows it all. Linus, her
younger brother, is intellectual but insecure. He still clings to his baby blanket for
security. Schroeder is preoccupied with Beethoven's music to the exclusion of
everything else.
Sally, Charlie Brown's younger sister, combines both a romantic attachment to Linus and
a desire for material things. Peppermint Patty is a tomboy who loves baseball, but
nonetheless has a romantic crush on Charlie Brown. Snoopy, the dog, represents a cool
detached inventive individual who also relies on basic creature comforts.
These characters add up to a "human comedy." In the comic strip, we can see ourselves
and the people around us: making mistakes, getting second chances, but tending to do
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
43 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
the same things over again.
Behind the humour of "Peanuts" there is a serious message. Words can hurt.
Relationships are important. Truth is difficult to find. Criticism is too common. Greed can
easily overpower us. These messages are both timeless and timely.
"Peanuts" has also been turned into television specials and several movies. Snoopy
stuffed toys are popular all over the world. A huge industry has grown from a simple
comic strip. Perhaps this means that, while we all secretly want to be "winners," we
really identify more closely with the Charlie Browns of this world!
