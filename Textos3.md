We wear the same size shoes, and we both have the same favorite colour.  
We are best friends, but sometimes we disagree about things.

If we were all exactly the same, the world would be a very boring place.  
I am myself, and I am glad that I am special.  
You are special too.  
Use your own special talents, and take the time to meet other people.  
The world is made up of a lot of different people; that's what makes life exciting.*

At night she curls up in my bed with me.  
She likes to be warm.  
I have given her a blanket of her own, but when I put her on it her tail twitches.  
Her tail twitches whenever she is upset or angry.

My favorite spring flowers are tulips and daffodils.  
The birds come back from the south.  
I can always tell that spring is here when I see my first robin of the season.  
The robins pull worms from the wet ground.  
When it isn't raining, my friends and I go outside and toss a ball around.  
We look forward to the summer, but we are glad to get outside after the long winter.  
The air smells so fresh in the spring.  
My mother always tells me not to track mud into the house.  
It's very muddy in our yard in the springtime.  
I wipe my muddy feet before I go into the house.  
There are a lot of puddles in my yard.  
I sometimes splash in the puddles, and I get wet and cold, so I have to go into the house.  
I like it when the snow has melted, the rain has stopped, and the sun comes out.  
On sunny days I always get together with my friends.  
On those days we either ride our bikes or play ball.  
My parents like to go for walks on spring evenings.  
They also like to clean up the yard in the spring.  
Everyone seems to be outside.  
The springtime brings people out of their houses.*

Her house was decorated with balloons and streamers.  
Her mother had baked a big birthday cake.  
The cake had "Happy tenth birthday Jane" written on it.  
There were ten candles on the cake.  
Jane blew out the candles and made a wish.  
I wonder what she wished for.  
Your wish won't come true if you tell anyone what it was.  
We sang "Happy birthday to you."  
At the party we played some games.  
I won one of games so I got a prize.  
We also swam in Jane's swimming pool.

Then we ate cake and ice cream.  
We had pop to drink.  
I think I had too much cake and ice cream.  
I was very full by the time the party was over.

It was a very good party.  
Everyone had a good time.  
I hope Jane had a happy tenth birthday.*

It is full of brightly coloured pictures.  
My teacher hangs pictures up all over the walls.  
There are blackboards at the front of the room.  
My teacher always has writing all over the blackboards.  
Sometimes the chalk squeaks when she writes on the blackboard.  
We cover our ears when that happens.  
Our classroom is full of desks.  
There are a lot of students in our class.  
Our desks are full of books, notebooks and pens.  
I try to keep my desk neat, but I have a lot of things in there.  
My ruler and pencils are always falling out of my desk.  
At the back of the room is a bookcase full of books.  
We can sign those books out and take them home to read.  
I have read a lot of the books.  
I like mysteries and biographies, so I have taken many of those home.  
There are also tables at the back of the room.  
That is where we do our artwork.  
We spread out big sheets of paper, and we use paints or crayons to make pictures.  
Sometimes we cut things out of magazines with scissors and we glue pictures to the paper.  
I like art class.  
After school, my friends and I often erase the blackboards for the teacher.  
Then we take the erasers outside and clap them together to get the chalk dust out of them.  
My friends and I walk home together and talk about what we did in school and what we're going to do after supper.*

## 69: Vacation.

>*My family and I went on vacation to Lake Huron.  
The water is beautiful and blue there, and the sand is nice and white.  
The week that we were there was very hot.  
The sun was hot, but the water was still very cold.  
I went swimming and tried to catch little fish in my hands.  
I was careful not to get sunburned.  
We stayed at a hotel that had a pool and a game room.  
I played pinball and video games sometimes.  
I liked to swim in the hotel pool, but I liked the beach better.  
I would lie on a big beach towel and get warm; then I would jump in the water and cool off.  
Sometimes I would just lie on the sand and watch the waves roll up on the shore.  
I found some seashells, and I saw a crab walking on the sand.  
At first I was a bit lonely because I didn't know anyone there.  
It wasn't long before I met some other kids my age.  
We built sandcastles together and swam in the lake.  
The other kids were from different towns, so we told each other stories about our schools and friends.  
We found that we had a lot in common even though we were from different places.  
Our families got together and went to restaurants together.  
We played volleyball on the beach, and we sat around a campfire at night and sang songs.  
At the campfire we would roast marshmallows on a stick.  
I always burn my marshmallows.  
That is okay.  
I like them that way.  
Mostly we just swam in the lake until we were very tired.  
I was sorry when our vacation was over.  
I had a good time at Lake Huron.  
I met some very good friends there.  
We still write to each other.  
Maybe we'll see each other next summer.*

## 71: My Family.

>*My grandparents are coming to visit us from Calgary, Alberta.  
My father is very happy because they are his parents, and he is glad that he will see them.  
We don't see them very often because Calgary is a long way from Toronto.  
My grandparents have two sons: my father and my Uncle Bill.  
Uncle Bill is married to my Aunt Susan.  
They have a daughter who is my cousin.  
My cousin is a lot older than I, so we do not have a lot in common.  
They also have a son who is the same age as me.  
He is my favorite cousin because we both like the same television shows and the same games.  
I have two brothers and one sister.  
My brothers are both younger than I.

We both have blonde hair and blue eyes.

My uncle will often take my cousin and me to the movies.  
I like to take my grandparents for walks so that they can see my school, and they can 
meet my friends.  
My parents talk to my brothers, my sister and I a lot.

People who have close families are very lucky.*

## 72: Winter.

>*Once the fall is over and the snowflakes start to fall I get very excited.  
I can hardly wait for the ground to be covered with a blanket of white snow.  
I put on my mittens, my scarf, my hat, coat and winter boots, and I run out into the fluffy snow.  
I have to be careful not to slip on the ice.  
It can get very icy and cold in the winter.  
The first thing that I do is to build a snowman.  
I sometimes build a snow fort too.  
My friends and I like to have a good snowball fight.  
We laugh a lot, and our cheeks and noses get very red.  
When we get too cold, we go into the house and have a cup of hot chocolate.  
My father fills the backyard with water that freezes and turns into an ice rink.  
When the ice is hard enough, my friends and I get our skates and we go out on the ice to play hockey.  
All of my friends own hockey sticks.  
I am usually the goalie, and I have to keep the puck from going into the net.  
My sister and her friends don't really like to play hockey.  
They would rather just skate around on the ice.  
I took skating lessons, so I don't usually fall down.  
My little brother is just learning to skate, so he falls down a lot.  
My father has to shovel the snow off the paths and the driveway in the winter.  
I help him.  
Shovelling snow is hard work.  
When my Dad and I finish shovelling the driveway, we go into the house and warm our 
hands and feet in front of the fireplace.  
There is probably nothing more beautiful than fresh fallen snow on the trees.  
In the morning, when the sun shines on the snow, it glistens.  
I like to leave my footprints in the snow.  
Winter can be very beautiful and exciting.*

## 73: Autumn.

>*Some people call autumn the "fall."  
You can call it either one.  
Autumn is the time when the leaves change colour.  
They change from green to beautiful shades of gold, orange and red.  
It looks like an artist has come along and painted all the trees.  
The air starts to get a little cooler in the autumn.  
We begin to wear jackets or sweaters.  
We go back to school in the autumn.  
The teacher sometimes gets us to make leaf collections.  
We collect different types of leaves and make a display of them.  
Autumn is the time when old friends get back together and talk about what they did on 
their summer vacations.  
Halloween comes in the autumn.  
We dress up in costumes.  
Some of them are scary, and some of them are funny.  
We go from door to door and say "Trick or treat" and people give us candies.  
We wear masks on our faces, and we have a lot of fun.  
The autumn winds start to blow.  
The wind blows the leaves right off the trees until the trees have bare branches.  
My friends and I like to have a lot of fun outside before the winter leaves us shivering.  
We play football and soccer at school.  
After school, we ride our bikes through piles of dry leaves.  
The leaves go flying through the air as we drive through them.  
My parents rake the leaves up and put them in big pile.  
I like to jump in the big piles of leaves, but then my parents just have to rake them up again.  
The skies get a little cloudier in the autumn, and we know that soon there will be snow, so we enjoy the brisk autumn weather while we can.*

## 74: Summer.

>*Yahoo! School is over!  
We are free for the summer.  
My friends and I run out on the last day of school into the bright summer sun.  
We sing a song about "no more pencils, no more books."  
We can hardly wait to do all the summer things that we like to do.  
We go swimming, we play baseball, we ride our bikes and we go to the beach.  
We go on vacations, or some of us go to summer camp.  
It is just nice to run barefoot through the grass or lie on your back and look up at the clouds.  
Summer days are lazy days.  
We don't have to do school work.  
We listen to the buzzing of the bees.  
We watch the birds as they fly from tree to tree.  
We go down to the pond and toss rocks into the water.  
We eat ice cream, and we have barbecues.  
Some of my friend's parents have boats, so we go for rides in their boats.  
Some of my friends go to their cottages.  
They have cottages on lakes.  
Some of my friends even have summer jobs.  
My best friend works at the supermarket.  
My father pays me to do jobs for him.  
I cut the grass, take out the garbage and wash the car.  
I like to be outside in the sunshine.  
On Sundays, my mother will pack a picnic lunch, and we go down to the park.  
Sometimes we play baseball.  
There is also a tennis court at the park.  
I am a very good tennis player.  
My sister just likes to swing on the swings and slide down the slide.  
We eat our sandwiches and watch out for the ants that always seem to be at picnics.  
After we have our lunch, my sister and I run off to play with the other children.  
My Dad has a nap, and my Mother reads her book.  
My skin gets brown from the sun in the summer.  
Summer is my favorite season.  
I like the sounds, smells and feelings that come with the summer sun.  
Summer is a lot of fun.  
I wish summer could go on forever.*

## 75: The Doctor.

>*I didn't feel very well last week.  
I had a sore throat and a fever.  
My mother took me to see the doctor.  
When we got there, the nurse took my name and said that the doctor would be with me soon.  
The doctor was a very nice man in a white jacket.  
I had seen the doctor before when I had my tonsils out at the hospital.  
The doctor took a light and looked in my ears.  
He put a stick on my tongue, and he shone his light into my mouth.  
He looked at my throat.  
He said that my throat was a bit swollen and red.  
He felt my neck and said that my glands were swollen.  
He took my temperature and said that it was quite high.  
He listened to my heart, and he made me cough.  
He asked me some questions.  
He said that he might have to do some tests.  
He sent me to get some blood taken out of my arm.  
I was scared, but it didn't really hurt.  
The doctor gave me some pills and told me to take one in the morning and one at night.  
He told me to drink a lot of fluids.  
He told me to get plenty of sleep.  
I did exactly what the doctor told me to do.  
It wasn't very long before I was feeling well again.  
I think that I might like to be a doctor when I grow up.  
I would like to make people feel better.*
