## 231 - Divorce.

>*Mary's parents just got a divorce.   
Mary is very upset.   
She thinks that her parents don't love her anymore.   
She thinks that they got a divorce because of her.   
She is wrong.   
Her parents love her just as much as they always did.   
They aren't getting divorced because of Mary.   
Sometimes, marriages just don't work out.   
It isn't really anyone's fault.   
Marriage isn't easy.   
It is hard for two people to stay together for a lifetime.   
Sometimes, people change as they get older, and they move on.   
Some people have perfectly good marriages, and they stay together for their entire lives.   
Divorce doesn't happen because the parents don't love the children anymore.   
A lot of children feel that it is their fault, but it isn't their fault at all.   
Children neither cause the divorce, nor can they prevent it.   
It is up to the parents.   
Divorce isn't the end of the world.   
Children can still see both parents and stay with them.   
Life goes on.   
Sometimes children can get new stepmothers or stepfathers.   
That can be a good thing.   
You just have to be understanding, and know that your parents still love you.   
Life doesn't always go the way that we planned it, but it has its twists and turns.   
Life is an adventure.   
If your parents get a divorce, just be understanding.   
Know that they love you and that this is a hard time for them.   
It is a hard time for you too, but these things have a way of working themselves out in the end.*

## 232 - If my Fish Could Talk.

>*I have a goldfish.   
He swims around in his bowl all day.   
He looks bored.   
I look inside the bowl and watch him.     
His mouth always moves.   
He looks like he is talking.   
I imagine what my goldfish would say if he really could talk.   
I think he would say: "Hey, I'm bored in this little bowl. Why don't you get me a bigger tank with more fish in it? I would like to have some friends to swim around with."   
I went out and bought a bigger tank for my goldfish.   
I put some plants at the bottom of the tank, and I got a miniature deep-sea diver to put at the bottom of the tank.   
I looked into the tank and imagined what my goldfish was saying.   
He seemed to be saying: "This is a nice tank. It's roomy in here, and you decorated it well, but I still don't have any friends to swim with."   
I went to the pet store and bought three more goldfish.   
I put them into the tank.   
All of the goldfish seemed to look at each other.   
They swam near each other and seemed to be playing games.   
I knew which one was my goldfish because he has a black spot on his fin.   
I looked at him, and imagined that he was talking again.   
He said: "This is great! I have a big new home and friends to swim with.   
These are nice goldfish that you brought home for me; thank you."   
Goldfish can't really talk.   
I know that.   
I just like to pretend that my goldfish talks.   
He seems very happy now with his nice new home, and his new friends.   
I don't think goldfish can smile either, but it looks like my goldfish has a smile on his face.*

## 233 - The Best Teacher.

>*I have had a lot of teachers.   
Some of them were good, and some of them were boring.   
There is one teacher whom I remember very well.   
He is the best teacher that I ever had.   
His name was Mr. Alban.   
He was a history teacher.   
History is not my favorite subject.   
I don't really enjoy history a lot.   
When I was in Mr. Alban's class, he made history seem exciting.   
He was more of an actor than a teacher.   
If he was describing a war, he would make us feel all the emotions that the soldiers and their families would have felt.   
We could almost hear the guns firing and the people shouting.   
He would paint a picture in our minds that was very vivid.   
When I had a history test in his class, I didn't have to study much.   
I would remember every word that he had said.   
I would see him doing the actions that went along with his stories.   
He was very animated.   
He would shout out orders as if he was a general, or he would speak softly and reverently when describing the death of a great hero.   
The most important thing that I learned from Mr. Alban was that I did really like history.   
I just thought that I didn't like it because most people had made it dull by just reading from the textbooks.   
History is not just a series of dates and dull facts.   
History is what really happened.   
History is real life.   
All the historical figures had real families and emotions.   
They weren't just fictional people.   
After I took history from Mr. Alban, I realized that I really did have an interest in it.     
He was my favorite teacher, and I will always be grateful to him for making me aware of just how interesting history really is.*

## 234 - Weather.

>*Sometimes, I watch the weatherman on television.   
It is fascinating to watch him point to different areas of the country on the map.   
He tells us where the weather will be nice and where it will be bad.   
The weatherman is not always right.   
Weather reporting is not an exact science.   
Nothing is very exact when it comes to the weather.   
The weather department does a lot of research, but they can never be sure of exactly what will happen.   
Sometimes, it looks like it will be clear, but the wind changes direction and clouds move in.   
The weatherman can warn people if there is a chance of a hurricane or tornado.   
The weatherman can also warn people of floods.   
Sometimes, entire towns have to be evacuated because of bad weather.   
It is important to be aware of the weather.   
For example, it is not good to be caught in the middle of a field when there is going to be a thunderstorm.   
You might want to take extra precautions if there is going to be a heavy snowstorm.   
You would need to be in a secure place if a hurricane or tornado was predicted.   
You might want to cancel a picnic if you knew that it would rain that day.   
The weather affects us in so many ways.   
Some people are really affected by dull, cloudy days.   
If there are no sunny days, they become very depressed.   
Heavy air pressure can cause some people to have headaches.     
Weather affects all of us in one way or another.   
It is always a topic of conversation.   
People often say things like "hello, it's a beautiful day today."   
Often we plan our lives and activities around the weather.   
So, if you are planning on walking home tonight, keep an eye on the sky.   
Are those rain clouds up there?   
You might need an umbrella.*

## 235 - How to Avoid Catching a Cold.

>*How many colds do you catch in a year?   
Most of my friends catch quite a few colds.   
They cough, sniffle and sneeze.   
They carry around tissues and blow their noses all the time.   
Their eyes water, and they have scratchy throats.   
I don't get many colds.   
In fact, I can go for a whole year and never catch a cold.   
That is why I consider myself an expert on how not to catch a cold.   
I'll tell you how to avoid catching a cold.   
I think that you need to take a lot of vitamin C.   
I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.   
I drink fruit juice too.   
I also take vitamin C pills.   
Whenever I begin to feel a cold coming on, I make sure that I have taken my vitamin C pill, and I drink a lot of orange juice.   
That usually knocks the cold right out of my system.   
I make sure that I get a lot of fresh air.   
In the winter, a lot of buildings are shut up tight so that the air is stale, and people's germs circulate through the buildings.   
I get outside and breathe in fresh clean air.   
If somebody is rude enough to cough or sneeze right in front of me without covering his or her mouth, I just hold my breath for a second.    
I'm not sure if this works or not, but I don't want to breathe in anybody's cold germs.   
Many germs are passed through hands.   
It is important to wash your hands thoroughly if you touch anything in a public place.   
If I hold a banister while I am walking down the stairs, I think of all the people who have used that banister, and I make sure that I wash my hands before I eat.   
Doorknobs also have a lot of germs on them.   
Money is another thing that is passed from hand to hand and is covered with germs.   
Sometimes, I see people stick money into their mouths.   
Just think of all the germs that you would be putting into your mouth if you did that.   
If you just give it a little bit of thought, you can avoid a lot of the germs that cause colds.   
If you eat good foods and stay fit, your body will be able to fight off the germs that cause colds and other diseases.   
It is not always possible to avoid colds, but if you do catch a cold, drink plenty of fluids and get a lot of rest.*

## 236 - The Future.

>*I sometimes wonder what life will be like in the future.   
Life has changed so much in just the past few years.   
I'm sure that there are still big changes that are coming.   
Do you think we'll still drive cars?   
Maybe we'll get into computerized vehicles that we won't have to drive.   
We'll just push a few buttons, and the vehicles will take us to wherever we have to go.   
Maybe there won't be roads.   
We might just fly through space to get where we want to go.   
Instead of telephones, we'll just use our computers.   
We'll be able to see each other when we talk.   
That type of thing is already happening.   
Maybe we won't have to cook our meals.   
We might be able to push buttons to order whatever we want.   
A nice roast beef dinner, or an ice cream sundae, might just pop out of a machine.   
It would be nice to have a robot to clean the house for you.   
In the past few years, computers have been extremely important.   
People used to write to each other through the mail.   
Now, people communicate so much more frequently through E-mail.   
Most of my friends own computers.   
If we had all of these things to do the work for us, what would we do?   
We would still need people to program the computers.   
We could spend more time being creative, rather than doing everyday chores.   
The future holds many surprises.   
I'm sure that technology will become even more and more amazing.   
When my parents were young, they had never even seen a color television.   
Nobody owned a computer.   
It doesn't take long for things to change a lot.   
Who knows what amazing things are in store for us?*

## 237 - Giving a Speech.

>*I had to give a speech last week.   
I gave a speech to three hundred people.   
I had to speak in front of a group of students.   
I had to tell them about a campaign that we were having to raise money for cancer research.   
Giving a speech can be a difficult thing.   
When you stand in front of a big crowd, you can get very nervous.   
Some people feel like they have weak knees.   
Their legs feel as if they are made of rubber.   
Their heart beats very hard inside of their chest.   
Their palms get sweaty.   
Some people even become short of breath.   
For some people, giving a speech is their worst fear.   
When you give a speech, everyone is looking at you.   
They are waiting to hear what you have to say.   
When you have three hundred people looking at you; you have six hundred eyes that are on you.   
It is a little frightening when you think of it that way.   
Before I give a speech, I take three big breaths.   
I calm myself, and I remind myself that what I have to say is important.   
I like to be sure of what I am going to say, so I practice my speech in front of a mirror at home.   
I like to look like I am relaxed and friendly.   
They say that practice makes perfect; so the more speeches that you give, the better you will become at it.   
Whenever I have to give a speech, I imagine that the audience is just one big person.   
I look out into the audience until I find a friendly, smiling face.   
I focus on that person, and I pretend that I am just talking to them.   
I have become used to giving speeches.   
I am more relaxed now than I used to be.   
People tell me that I do not look nervous at all.   
I like to hear that.   
Sometimes I do feel a little flutter of nervousness, but I just ignore it and do the best that I can.   
Giving a speech is not as scary as it appears to be.   
Anyone can do it with a little practice.*

## 238 - Moving to Another Country.

>*My friend Steve moved to another country.   
He had lived in Canada all his life, and he moved to Japan.    
Life in Japan was very different for Steve than what he was used to.   
At first, Steve suffered from culture shock.   
His whole life seemed different.   
He was not used to the way of life in Japan.   
Steve was not used to the large crowds of people that walked up and down the streets in Japan.   
In his hometown in Canada, the streets were fairly quiet.   
Steve had to get used to the food.   
In Japan, the people eat a lot of fish.   
Steve had never eaten much fish before.   
Steve wanted pizza, but it was expensive in Japan.   
Steve said that he had to adjust his eating habits.   
The people in Japan have different customs than we do here in Canada.   
Steve didn't want to offend anyone, so he had to learn the customs.   
He had to learn about what Japanese people considered polite and rude.   
Sometimes, in a foreign country you can do something to insult someone without even realizing that you are being rude.   
At first, Steve had trouble with the language.   
He said that the only way to really learn the language is to talk to people.   
Steve talked to a lot of people.   
He made a lot of mistakes, but people were patient with him, and they tried to help him with his Japanese.   
It wasn't long before Steve felt more comfortable in his new surroundings.   
You have to be willing to learn new customs and a new language if you move to another country.   
Steve feels very comfortable in Japan, and in Canada now.   
He is thinking about going to another country now.   
He thinks that he might like to try and live in Italy.   
I'm sure that he would get over his culture shock very fast if he moved there.   
Moving to a new country can be difficult, but if you are willing to learn, it can be a very rewarding experience.*

## 239 - Look for the Beauty.

>*I have learned that things don't always go the way that they were planned.   
If something doesn't happen the way that I want it to, I try to make the best of the situation.   
I always try to find something good in everything that happens.   
Last year, I broke my ankle when I was walking on an icy sidewalk.     
At first, I was very upset.   
I was missing school, and there was a party that I wanted to go to.   
I couldn't do very much of anything.   
My ankle was very sore.   
I stayed home, and I read a book.   
It was an excellent book, and one that I probably would not have had time to read under normal circumstances.   
My friends brought my homework to my house, and we had some really nice visits while they were here.   
I had to accept the fact that I couldn't go anywhere on my broken ankle, so I made the best of a bad situation.   
Once, I lost my way when I was out camping.   
I ended up in a very large field.   
I was afraid that nobody would find me, but I calmed myself down and took time to examine all the interesting wildflowers in the field.   
My family did find me.   
They were surprised at how calm I was.   
I have learned that there is something valuable inside every adventure and something beautiful inside every person.   
We had a new boy who came into our class.   
His clothes weren't in style, and he was not particularly handsome.   
Some of the boys and girls made fun of him.   
Sometimes, people can be really cruel.   
He seemed to handle it all right, but inside, I knew that it must hurt.   
Some of my friends and I invited him out with us.   
We found out that he had a terrific sense of humor, and he is probably one of the nicest people that I have ever met.   
He has since become one of my best friends.   
It makes me ashamed when someone that I know judges someone by how they look.   
It isn't fair to do that.   
You'll find that something good comes out of almost every situation.   
You'll find something good about almost everyone that you meet if you look hard enough.   
If something doesn't work out the way you planned it, just make the best of the situation.   
Look for the beauty in everything.*

## 240 - My Doll.

>*When I was an infant, I got a rag doll.   
It was a very plain, little doll, and it wore a clown outfit and a clown's hat.   
I used to take that doll to bed with me every night.   
I couldn't go to bed without my doll.   
My mother used to pretend that the doll was talking to me.   
She would make the doll dance and sing songs.   
I would talk to the doll.   
My mother would answer for the doll, but I was a baby, and I thought that the doll was actually talking to me.   
That doll was my best friend.   
I took her everywhere.   
One time I took her to a store with me, and I left her on a shelf in the store.   
We were halfway home when I realized that I didn't have my doll with me.   
I was very upset.   
My mother and I rushed back to the store.   
My doll was still there.   
I was so relieved.   
I hugged my doll, and I promised myself that I would never leave her anywhere again.   
I couldn't imagine life without that doll.   
Through the years, the doll became less important in my life.   
I had other things to do, but the doll still sat on my bed during the day, and I still took it to bed at night.   
I gave that doll a lot of love when I was little.   
In fact, I loved the doll so much that she looks tattered and torn now.   
There are parts of her face and hands that are almost worn away.   
I had a lot of other toys when I was little, but none of them were ever so important as that doll.   
I don't play with toys anymore, but that doll is still in my room.   
She sits in a special chair in the corner.   
I'll always have that doll.   
No matter how worn out she is, I'll always keep her and cherish her as a part of my early childhood.*

## 241 - I am Curious.

>*I am curious about many things.   
I would like to find the answers to a lot of questions that I have.   
What holds the stars up in the sky?   
Why does ice form on the top of the lake when it is cold?   
Is there life on other planets?   
Why do we not fall off the face of the earth?   
How do caterpillars turn into butterflies?   
All of these things are mysteries to me.   
There are so many questions that are unanswered.   
I think I should go to the library and get a book to find out why people grow old.   
What makes a television work?   
I also want to know where electricity comes from.   
Who is the strongest person in the world?   
Who is the smartest person in the world?   
Why do some people have blonde hair, and some people have black hair?   
Why do people in different countries speak different languages?   
Why do people have to die?   
Why are no two snowflakes alike?    
What makes people fall in love?   
What makes the rivers run?   
Why does the sun rise every morning?   
How did the oceans form?   
Why did the dinosaurs vanish from the earth?   
I wonder if I'll ever find out the answers to all my questions.   
I think I'll have to study hard and stay in school to find out everything that I want to know.   
Some questions never get answered.   
It is good to be curious.   
People who are curious about things are the ones who learn a lot, and some curious people go on to invent things and make important discoveries.*

## 242 - Creative People.

>*Some people are just born to create.   
That's what I think.   
Some people just have the need to write stories, compose beautiful music, or paint pictures.   
Creativity seems to be inside them, and they need to let it out.   
It's good that we have people like that.   
Composers like Mozart and Chopin have given us music that is incredibly beautiful.   
It's not just the classical composers who have given us great pieces of music; there are modern composers who have written great songs also.   
Elton John is an example of someone who has composed many wonderful songs.   
Andrew Lloyd Webber has given us some very popular musicals like Cats and The Phantom of the Opera.   
There are so many talented and creative people in this world.   
When you visit an art gallery, you marvel at how artists are able to recreate realism or make up something that seems totally unreal yet beautiful.   
The American artist Norman Rockwell painted some pictures that actually looked like photographs.   
He tried to portray life as it was in America.   
Through his paintings, one can get a good sense of American life through the years.   
On the other hand, artists like Jackson Pollock did not portray realism.   
Jackson Pollock painted abstract pictures.   
His paintings are just as good as Norman Rockwell's, but they are entirely different.   
Some books that we read are classics.   
Mark Twain portrayed American life through his characters Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.   
Charles Dickens brought Victorian England to life through his books.   
Most people are familiar with his Christmas Carol where the mean and miserable Scrooge learns the true meaning of Christmas.   
People don't have to read the classics.   
There are modern writers who entertain readers through their stories.   
Stephen King has written a number of horror stories.   
Some of his books have even been made into movies.   
We are lucky to have creative people who share their gifts with us.   
If you are lucky enough to be creative, you should use your talents to create works of art that we all can share.*

## 243 - Career Choices.

>*What do you want to be when you grow up? There are so many things that you can be.   
You might want to work in the field of law.   
You could be a police officer.   
You could be a judge or a lawyer.   
Maybe you'd like to work in the food industry.   
You could be a cook or a waitress.   
You might want to manage a hotel dining room.

You could sing or play an instrument in a band.   
If you like to help people, you could go into medicine.   
You could be a doctor or a nurse.   
You might be a surgeon and operate on people.   
There are other jobs in the field of medicine too.   
You could be an x-ray technician or a lab technician.     
It takes a lot of education to be a doctor.   
Maybe you would rather be a teacher.   
You could teach in a primary school or a high school.   
If you don't want to work with children, you could become a professor at a university.   
There are hundreds of other jobs to choose from too.   
You might want to fix cars or work in a store.   
You could be a dentist or a veterinarian.   
You could be a janitor or a zookeeper.   
There are so many jobs that I just can't name them all.   
Maybe you'd like to be a minister or an organist at a church.   
You could be a babysitter or a shop clerk.   
You might be interested in being an astronaut or a baker.   
You could work in a bank or at a shop.   
You could work on a construction crew and build roads and houses.   
Maybe you'd rather decorate the houses, so you'd become an interior decorator.   
You could cut hair or be a driving instructor.   
The list is endless.   
There are even jobs that you may never have heard about.   
The choice is yours.   
You just choose whatever you want to be and do your best to become that.   
I could go on forever.   
you could work in a library.   
You could be a factory worker or a fisherman.   
You could make clothes or build bridges.   
You could wash windows or be a bricklayer.   
The possibilities are endless.*

## 244 - I Need Glasses.

>*I have been having trouble seeing the blackboard.  
Everything is blurry.   
I keep getting headaches.   
I told my mother about it, and she made an appointment with the optometrist.   
I went to a place where they made me read words and letters on a chart.   
Some of the words were big, and some were very small.   
I tried to read everything, but sometimes I couldn't see some of the small letters.   
The optometrist would cover one of my eyes while I read the chart.   
Then, she would cover my other eye.   
She even put some drops in my eyes.   
I asked the optometrist if I had passed or failed the test.   
She laughed, and said that it wasn't the kind of test that you passed or failed.   
She was just trying to find out if I needed glasses.   
I did need glasses.   
My mother and I looked around.   
There were many pairs of frames.   
I wanted something that was in style.   
I tried on many pairs of frames.   
Some of them looked good on me, and some of them looked really funny on me.   
I finally chose a frame that was my favorite.   
I gave them to a lady who did some measurements.   
She told me to come back on Friday to get my glasses.   
On Friday, I got my glasses.   
My friends liked them.   
They said I looked smart in my glasses.   
I wore them to school on Monday, and I was able to see the blackboard clearly.   
I didn't realize how much I hadn't been able to see.   
Now I don't get headaches anymore.   
I'm glad that I have my glasses.   
Everything is a lot clearer now.*

## 245 - I am Clumsy.

>*My mother says that I am clumsy.   
My father says that I am clumsy.   
I know that I am clumsy.   
I do things all the time that are clumsy.   
I fall down for no reason at all.   
If there is a crack in the sidewalk, I will be sure to trip on it and fall down.   
If I carry a plate of food in the cafeteria, I almost always either drop it or bump into someone with it.   
I don't try to do these things, it just happens.   
When I drink juice, I miss my mouth and get juice all over my shirt.   
I always have something spilled on my clothes.   
Last week I opened a jar of peanut butter.   
The jar flew out of my hands and landed upside down on the floor.   
There was a big glob of peanut butter on the floor.   
Yesterday I knocked over the sugar bowl.   
There was a big sticky mess on the floor.   
I bump my head when I get into the car.   
I rip my pants on things.   
I lose my money out of my pockets.   
I step on the cat's tail.   
I always feel bad when I do that because the cat thinks I don't love her.   
I don't mean to do these things.   
I am just a clumsy person.   
My parents tell me to slow down.   
I am always in a hurry; maybe that's why I'm so clumsy.   
Maybe it's just a stage that I am going through.   
If it is, I hope it is over soon.   
Being clumsy is no fun at all.*

## 246 - Home Alone.

>*I remember the first time that my parents left me home alone.   
I was very grown up, and I thought that I would be just fine.   
I was fine for a while.   
I watched television and had something to eat.   
I called my friend on the phone, and we talked for a while.   
Then, I sat down to read a book.   
The house was quiet, very quiet.   
I found myself listening very carefully.   
I heard a tap, tap tapping noise.   
I wondered where it was coming from.   
It seemed to be coming from the window.   
I turned out the lights so that nobody would see me, and I peeked out the window carefully.   
I was expecting to see a robber tapping at my window.   
There was nobody there.   
It was just a tree branch swaying in the breeze and tapping at my window.   
I felt silly.   
I turned on the lights and sat back down to read my book.   
A few minutes later, I heard some creaking noises.   
I listened carefully.   
Then, I heard a clunking noise.   
I think it might have been the furnace.   
Then there was a whirring noise.   
My imagination began to play tricks on me.   
I was imagining that there were all kinds of creatures in the house.   
I told myself to grow up.   
I wouldn't let my imagination run away with me.   
I was glad when my parents got home.   
I told them about all the noises that I had heard.   
My parents laughed and said that all houses make noises.   
We're usually just so busy that we don't hear all the noises that go on.   
I have stayed home alone many times now.   
I just ignore all the little creaks and noises that I hear.   
I am still alert and listen for anything suspicious, but I know that there are lots of noises that are harmless.   
That tree that taps on my window still frightens me sometimes, but I'm a lot braver now than I was the first time that I stayed home alone.*

## 247 - Family.

>*What does the word "family" mean to you?   
The easiest way to define family is to talk about who you are related to.   
Usually, there is a mom and a dad and children who are brothers and sisters.   
This would be the "core" family.   
Then there is the "extended" family which would include grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews and in-laws (people married to your brothers or sisters, husband or wife).   
However, I think the word "family" has a much deeper meaning.   
The word "family" brings words to my mind like: love, support, help, kindness, fun, love, trips, closeness, love, forgiving, sharing, love, understanding, respect and love! You'll notice one word that is repeated over and over again.   
LOVE. I believe if a family has real love for one another, they will be able to overcome any problems they may have.   
Actually, they may not have too many problems if they all love and respect one another.   
However, there are things that cannot be helped; like death, sickness or accidents.   
It is during those hard times that a family's love helps them to go through those experiences.   
We had quite a few children in my family.   
There were brothers and sisters which included an adopted brother and a number of foster children, too.   
I was also very fortunate that I had both my mom and dad to live with and do things like vacations together.   
We had a lot of fun and there were sometimes of tears, too.   
Above all, we love one another! Family is a wonderful thing! I am so lucky!*

## 248 - My First Job.

>*My first "real" job was during my last year of high school.   
I had taken classes in various business subjects.   
In that last year of high school, we could do a "co-op".   
That meant we could work part of the time instead of going to school.   
It would count as a credit towards our diploma.   
The place I got a job was at a men's tailor shop.   
The owners were a very nice older German couple.   
They had two other men working for them, too.   
One of the men had had brain surgery for cancer.   
He had a big, long scar all around the top of his head.   
He told me all about it.   
He was always happy and full of fun.   
I thought he was very brave! The tailor shop made suits to order.   
One of the salesmen would measure the man, and the customer would choose a fabric and style he (or his wife!) liked.   
The people in the back of the shop would then cut and sew the suit.   
The suits cost a lot of money.   
There were also suits already made that the customer could buy instead if they wished.   
They could also rent suits or tuxedos for weddings or parties.   
I worked at a little desk.   
I answered the phone, wrote letters, filed papers and did some bookkeeping.   
It was about a mile walk from my school to work.   
I passed many clothing shops.   
That wasn't good because I spent a lot of the money that I earned in those shops!   
I worked at the tailor shop for almost a year.   
It was a good experience and helped me get my next job with the United States Navy.   
That was fun, too!*

## 249 - First Trip Away From Home.

>*Today I am going to my friend's house.   
Her name is Valerie.   
This is going to be my first trip away from home, without my parents.   
My dad is driving me to Valerie's house, and I'll be staying there for two weeks.   
Her mom will drive me back home.   
It takes about l l/2 hours to get there.   
I have to pack enough clothes for play, work and church.   
I hope I'll pack the right things.   
Of course, I have to remember my toothbrush and hairbrush.   
Valerie lives on a farm.   
I'll be helping her dad with milking the cows--I think!   
We'll play up in the hayloft after we have helped put the bales into the barn.   
We'll be all itchy when that job is done!   
There are a lot of things to do on a farm.    
Her mom is a good cook and will feed us well!   
There is a nice pond where we can go swimming.   
I mustn't forget my bathing suit.   
I wonder if the farm dog comes into the pond, too.   
That would be funny! My dad and mom are giving me money just in case we go shopping.     
I hope we do go shopping because I want to buy lots of candy.   
(I won't tell my mom that!)  Oh, dear!   
I hear Dad yelling, "Let's go!" I haven't even finished packing my things yet.   
I guess I better stop writing this now and get busy fast! Bye!*

## 250 - My Job.

>*I work at a conservation park called Ball's Falls.   
I've only worked there for three weeks now.   
I am a Tour Guide, and I tell people the history of all the old buildings there.   
Somebody told me that one of the houses I work in is haunted.   
Now I get chills every time I walk into that house!   
My boss told me that the stories aren't real, but I have an active imagination!   
Ball's Falls is very beautiful.   
It has two different water falls, the Upper Falls and the Lower Falls.   
There used to be tons of water cascading over them, which turned a big water wheel to grind grain.   
However, through the years the amount of water has really lessened.   
I love working at Ball's Falls because I get to work outside a lot.   
I am getting a tan!   
In July and August, I will be working with kids there at a day camp.   
I am getting ready now, making different crafts and thinking up fun new games to play.   
I can't wait to start working with them.   
I think that will be the best part of the summer.   
I will be going to work again tomorrow.   
I usually have to work from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.   
I also like the people I work with.   
They are very nice.   
Come to Ball's Falls, and I'll give you a tour!*

## 251 - My Hobby.

>*Let's see.   
Today I might go fly a kite, or maybe go for a swim.   
It is hot outside, and I don't know what to do.   
My mom tells me that I should do something that I like doing on hot days.   
Since our house is nice and cool, I guess I'll stay inside and work on my hobby.   
My hobby is something that not a lot of people do.   
I make and collect bookmarks.   
To make my bookmarks, I use stickers, and special art pencils to draw.   
I buy the stickers at a mall, usually in a card store.   
The art pencils are bought in an art store.   
To make the bookmarks, I start with a piece of paper.   
I measure out how big I want the bookmark to be with a ruler.   
I once made a bookmark so big, that it couldn't even be used in a very big book!   
After I measure it, I draw lines so that I can cut it straight.   
Sometimes, I use fancy scissors that cut zig-zags or frills.   
Then I start to decorate them.   
I like to draw cartoons and flowers on my bookmarks.   
Sometimes, I even put real flowers on them.   
A lot of the time I write little sayings on the bookmarks.   
I like to give my bookmarks to friends and family.   
Sometimes, I even sell my bookmarks to people.   
I like my hobby.   
I can draw whatever I want on the bookmarks.   
Maybe sometime in the future I will be a famous bookmark maker and even have my own store!*

## 252 - If I Had a Million Dollars.

>*If I had a million dollars, I'd travel the world.   
I would go to the highest mountain.   
I would swim the deepest sea.   
I would probably buy a lot of clothes because I love clothes!   
More than anything though, I would want to visit Ireland.   
I want to see the rolling hills and the green, green grass that everyone talks about.   
When I think of Ireland, I think of where my family came from many years ago.   
I am almost all Irish and would love to see my family over in Ireland.   
If I had a million dollars, I would buy a Mustang or a Pontiac Sunbird car.   
I would buy a nice house with a big backyard and an outdoor and indoor pool.   
I would love to take my family wherever they wanted to go.   
I would buy them wonderful presents, too.   
However, I know that money does not buy happiness.   
It does not buy you friends or family.   
It may bring some happiness only for the moment, but in the long run your family
is what will be there for you if you love them and are there for them.   
If I had to pick between a million dollars and my family, I would pick my family.   
The million dollars is a nice dream.   
If that dream ever comes true and I do get a lot of money, I hope I would use it wisely.*

## 253 - A Picnic.

>*What a great day for a picnic!   
We're not only having a picnic; we're having a big bike ride, too.   
We did this last year with a lot of friends also. It was really fun.   
We meet quite early in the morning in a pretty little town.   
The town is where the Niagara River flows into Lake Ontario in Canada.   
The town's name is Niagara-on-the-Lake.   
Then all of the people, fifty or more, get on their bikes or roller blades.   
We go on a bike path beside the river.   
The path we take is about 11 km or 6 miles long.   
There are a lot of other people using the path, too.   
We usually stop for an ice cream treat near the end or where we turn around to go back
to our cars.   
It is just before the park where we will have our picnic, and a steep hill.   
Many of the men and boys go up the hill.   
Most of the women and children go back to their cars.   
The ride takes about two hours plus whatever time we take at the ice cream store.   
After the ride is finished, we go the park.   
We have a delicious "pot-luck" lunch.   
Pot luck means everyone brings some food to share with the others.   
We eat, rest, talk and laugh.   
After we've cleaned up, some of us climb the tower that is there remembering a war at
that place and its general.   
It is a steep climb, over l00 steps.   
We usually end the day with a fun game of baseball or soccer.   
Finally, we pack up our stuff.   
Tired and dirty, we head for home with good memories swimming in our heads.*

## 254 - Working in my Yard.

>*I live in a house that has a small yard around it.   
In my yard there is a lawn and a garden.   
There is also a sidewalk that leads to my front door, and a driveway that leads to my
garage.   
Throughout the year I work to maintain my yard.   
During the summer, I cut the grass that grows in my yard, using a lawn-mower.   
I like the smell of the grass when it has just been cut.   
But it's better not to cut the grass too short.   
When the weather is dry, I also put water on the lawn and garden, so that the grass and
flowers can grow.   
During the autumn, many leaves fall from the trees in my yard.   
I use a rake to collect the leaves from the lawn.   
Then I can put the leaves into bags.   
I can use the leaves to make fertilizer.   
When I was a kid, I didn't like the job of raking leaves, but now I don't mind it.   
Another job during the autumn is to remove flowers from the garden before the cold
weather arrives.   
During the winter, there is no work to do in the lawn or garden, because they are covered
in snow.   
But I need to keep the snow off my sidewalk and driveway.   
Whenever it snows, I use a shovel to clear the snow from the sidewalk and the driveway.    Sometimes it snows a lot.   
If I didn't shovel the snow, it would soon be impossible to get into my house!   
During the spring, the snow melts.   
I clean up my yard by sweeping away dirt and by removing weeds from the lawn and garden.   
I also put flowers back into the garden.   
It's nice to see them again after the long, cold winter.   
When spring comes, the grass grows very quickly, so I need to cut the grass quite often.   
Working in the yard can be very satisfying work.   
It's so nice when the lawn and garden are looking green and healthy.*

## 255 - Early Morning.

>*"Yawn!" I am so tired.   
I don't like getting up in the morning.   
I wish I could sleep in until noon.   
My mom has to come into my room and shake my feet.   
"Get up, you lazy girl!" she says, "It's time to rise and shine. It's a beautiful day!"   
I raise my head, mumble and turn over, putting my pillow over my head.   
My mom yanks my pillow from off my head and starts tickling me.   
"Okay, I'll get up!" I shriek.   
The sun is so bright that I squint.   
I think I will go outside and play.   
I can't wait to get up now.   
My mom cooks me breakfast.   
I have eggs, bacon, toast and orange juice.   
When I finish my breakfast.   
I brush my teeth, comb my hair, wash my face and then change into play clothes.   
I choose a bright pink and yellow tank top with jean shorts and blue sandals.   
My bike is in the garage where my dad keeps the cars and tools.   
As I pedal, my hair flies out behind me!   
I keep my mouth shut so that bugs don't get in!    
I am going down a big hill now.   
I can hardly pedal anymore.   
My legs are moving so fast.   
I hang onto my handle bars tightly.    
I don't want to fall off!   
I finally am able to slow down as the road becomes level.   
I turn a corner and decide to go back home.   
I realize I now have to ride up the hill!   
I know I will be tired when I get to the top.   
I think that I will have some water now before I start to go up.   
Mmmm, it tastes great!   
It is so clean and cold.   
Well, I know that I have a big trip ahead of me, so I need to get going!   
Bye-bye!*

## 256 - The Wedding.

>*We went into the church and sat down.   
There were pretty flowers at the front.   
There was beautiful organ music playing.   
The church was full of people dressed up nicely.   
Everyone was waiting to see the beautiful bride walk up the aisle.   
A hush, and intake of breath.   
There she was!   
Oh, she was so beautiful!   
She had a lovely, long white dress with pretty lace and beads.   
Her hair was swept up off from her face.   
There were curls flowing down her back.   
Instead of a veil, she had little flowers in her hair.   
Her bouquet of tiny flowers was very, very pretty.   
Her dad looked very proud of her.   
He looked just a little sad, too.   
At the front of the church, the groom stood waiting.   
He had a beautiful tender smile on his face.   
He took his bride's hand as her dad left her there.    
They smiled at each other.   
The minister read, prayed and offered some words of advice to the lovely couple.   
Someone sang a pretty song.   
The groom slipped the simple wedding band on the bride's finger.   
She struggled a little to put a band on his finger.   
Pretty soon the minister said they were now husband and wife.   
They kissed.   
We all stood, and they walked down the aisle to live the rest of their lives together as Mr. And Mrs.!   
We cried.*

## 257 - The Perfect Place.

>*There is a place in my mind that is pure.   
Everything there is beautiful.   
Many flowers grow, and the grass is very green.   
The clouds are always white and fluffy.   
The tree's branches sweep the earth floor.   
You can hear the sound of a waterfall.   
It is roaring with life, and the water races.   
A bird calls in the distance and as you listen, the sound gets closer.   
A flapping quite near makes me turn and look.   
A great, magnificent eagle flies over my head.   
The strength I see in his powerful wings amazes me!   
I am never thirsty or hungry.   
I live off the beauty that surrounds me in this perfect place.   
I walk on trails that lead me to breath-taking places.   
The beach is my favourite spot to end up.   
The sand between my toes is soft and cool.   
I love to lie down on the sand.   
I watch the sun go down.   
Sometimes the sun is a brilliant orange.   
The world seems like it is on fire!   
Waves lull me to sleep.   
The seagulls wake me up.   
In this perfect place I have learned so much.   
The animals and their homes are so precious.   
I have learned to respect the animals; they were here first.   
The sounds, smells, and sights are too perfect and full of life.    
There is no war here, no anger or stress.   
I don't have to worry about pollution or destruction.   
My perfect world exists only in my head.   
Maybe if we all work hard, my fantasy can become real!*

## 258 - Visiting the Zoo.

>*When I was a kid, I always enjoyed visiting the zoo.   
My family lived far away from the zoo, so we didn't go there very often.   
But whenever we went to the zoo, I always had a fun and interesting time.   
Some of the animals were very large.   
Of course, the elephants were huge, and they had such an unusual appearance, with their big ears and their long trunk and tusks.   
The giraffes were very tall, with long necks that reached high into the trees.   
Some of my favorite animals were the big cats.   
The lions looked very powerful, with their big teeth and paws.   
The tigers were just as big and strong, with yellow and black stripes.   
But the bears were even larger than these cats.   
The polar bears, with their bright white fur, liked to swim through the water.   
The grizzly bears had brown fur and liked to roam around on land.   
The animals from Australia seemed very unusual.   
The kangaroos, with their strong legs and long tail, could jump great distances across the ground.   
The baby kangaroo could go inside its mother's pouch.   
Another Australian animal, the koala bear, crawled slowly in the trees, where it ate leaves.   
The monkeys and apes were also very interesting.   
In many ways, they reminded me of people.   
Some of the monkeys were very small.   
They could use their arms, legs, and tail to swing through the trees.   
Some of the apes were very large.   
The gorilla was the largest of all.   
Sometimes a big gorilla would stand up and pound his fists on his chest.   
To see all the animals at the zoo took almost a whole day.   
By the end of the day, I was very tired from walking around.   
But I was also very happy to see all the amazing animals from places around the world.*

## 259 - The Dentist Appointment.

>*My dentist called my house the other day.   
He told me I needed my teeth cleaned.   
I set up an appointment to see him on Saturday, June l0th.   
When I got to my dentist's office, I had to sit in the waiting room.   
There were other people ahead of me.   
They finally called my name.   
I went into his room and sat down on a big blue chair.   
They leaned it back.   
A bright light was turned on.   
It hurt my eyes, so I closed them.   
My dentist asked me to open my mouth.   
I did.   
I thought my mouth was very big, but he told me to open it even wider!   
Soon he began poking around to see if I had any cavities.   
He flossed my teeth and put fluoride around my teeth too.   
The fluoride tasted like bubble gum.   
I had to spit into a dish-like bowl.   
It squirted out water.   
My dentist kept asking me questions.   
I couldn't answer because there were weird tools in my mouth! When I tried answering back, he seemed to understand though.   
His helper came into the room.   
She asked me to open my mouth again.   
I had to clamp down on something that felt like rubber.   
She put a big camera-type machine right next to my cheek.   
She did this on the other side of my face as well.   
They took two pictures of my teeth.   
It was really cool.   
The dentist told me my teeth were perfect!   
I didn't have any problems.   
I could go home.   
"See you next year," he said.*

## 260 - Day Dream.

>*Little Annie was very bored one lazy afternoon.   
She had nothing to do!   
She had already played with her brothers in the sandbox and had tea with them and her dollies, too.   
She had baked chocolate chip cookies with her mom and even tasted one!   
They were very good, she thought.   
Now Annie was trying to figure out what else she could do to pass the day away.   
Little Annie decided that she would go to her favourite spot in the world... the green,
grassy field full of daisies, beneath the great oak tree.   
She took a red and white blanket with her.   
She laid it down on the ground, and then she lay down on it.   
She lay there looking at the clouds, fluffy and white.   
She saw bunnies, huge gray elephants and scary-looking crocodiles.   
Soon, Little Annie was drifting in and out of clouds and reality.   
The clouds started dancing with her, begging her to come and play.   
She got up from her blanket and joined the clouds.   
They flew over roof tops of all of the village people, swam with the fish in the lake and said hello to all of the birds that they passed by.   
Little Annie was having so much fun!   
The clouds had formed into a chariot so Little Annie could drive if she wanted to.   
She drove over a rainbow that was bright in the sky.   
Then, she shot through the branches of her friend's spruce tree!   
Annie suddenly came to a STOP!   
Hearing someone call her name, Annie looked around.   
She blinked; once, twice, and finally everything came into focus.   
Her brother was tugging at her leg, wondering why she was staring into outer space with a big grin on her face!   
"Oh," Little Annie said, not really knowing that she had been sitting there all along.*
