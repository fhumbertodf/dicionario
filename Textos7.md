Music
A song comes on the radio. My lips start to move, singing along. My fingers start to snap;
my feet begin to tap. The music sinks deep into my soul. I listen to the music as it fills my
brain, and I remember when I used to sing. I sang in front of huge crowds. I loved it when
they watched me and clapped for me when I was finished.
Letting out my feelings when I was sad, mad, happy, or glad was when I would sing. I
sang in the shower; I sang in the rain; I sang in church; I sang walking down the street!
Music has always been a big part of my life. It seems like I was a baby when I started
playing the piano! I would sit on my sister's lap while she played the piano, and I would
bang on the keys. I remember sitting beside her and learning how to sing. I sang my little
lungs out!
As I grew, I listened to other singers on tapes, the radio and C.D.s. I took those things
that I heard from different singers and made myself sound like them. Soon, I could take
what I had heard all my life and make it into my own sound.
I have always liked singing jazz and blues. I don't listen to jazz and blues a lot, however. I
listen to pop, rock, classical and some country. As you can see, I like many types of
music. I have seen musicals, too, like Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables. Those
musicals were amazing. There were such bright costumes and stage sets, not to mention
the wonderful songs and singing.

Music has been on this earth since the beginning of time, and it touches every one in a
different way. I know it has not only touched me, but is a big part of my very being!

First Data
"Ring, ring." The phone is ringing. My mother answers it. "Hello," she says. It is for me.
When I pick up the phone, I hear a boy's voice. It is a boy I go to school with.
This boy is very nice, and he is cute, too. He asks me if I want to go out for dinner with
him tonight. I say yes. He is going to pick me up at 5:30 p.m. in the evening. He has a
nice red car.
Before he picks me up, I have to find an outfit to wear. I am nervous and don't know what
to wear. So my sister picks out an outfit for me. I feel excited and have the sensation of
butterflies in my stomach. The inside of my hands are damp, too. I put on my outfit and
do my hair. My sister gives me some nice clips to put in my hair.
"Ding-dong," the doorbell buzzes. My date is here! I hurry to the door, so I can greet him.
He tells me that I look nice and that we are going to a place called M-T Bellies.
When we arrive at M-T Bellies, there is loud music playing. A smiling waitress comes who
serves us our food. I order a large caesar salad. My date orders steak. When it arrives,
the food looks and is delicious! The waitress asks us if we want dessert after we've
finished. But we are too full. So we ask for our bill to pay.
My date pays for the meal. I brought money just in case we would share the cost. When
we leave the restaurant, we go for a walk by the river. It is a beautiful night.
I am enjoying my first date. I am laughing and having fun. It is time for us to go home. So
my date takes me home. I smile and thank him for the great time. I hope he'll ask me out
again!

University
It's time to sign up for school. This year Natalie is going to Brock University. She has
never been to university before. She is a little bit scared. She hopes she meets nice, new
friends. Natalie stood in line to get her picture taken. The picture was put on a card. The
card was her picture ID (identification). She would use this card if she needed to buy
books from the school bookstore; if she wanted to get a book from the library; or if she
wanted to use the pool!
After all of the signing up and money was paid, Natalie went out to lunch with her mother.
"Mom, I'm kind of scared about going to school. I'm going to be the youngest kid there. I
don't know how to take notes. The teachers might be mean....", Natalie rambled on. Her
mom just calmed her down and said, "Take one day at a time, Natalie. Worry only about
today." "Hmmm. You're right, Mom. Thanks!"
Natalie was very scared on the first day of school. She made sure she had all of the
books she needed and lots of pens, pencils and erasers. She walked into the front of the
building and went on her way to try and find her classroom.
Natalie got through her classes and met a lot of new people, nice people. Her classes
seemed to go by really fast, and the day went by even faster.
When Natalie got home she was so excited. She told her mom that classes weren't all

that scary; the students and the teachers weren't scary either! Natalie knew that the
school work would be hard, but she felt good about the people she had met that day. She
knew she'd have a good year.

School Dance
It is the first school dance that I have ever been to. All of the boys are standing on one
side of the gymnasium, and all of the girls are on the other side. There is loud music
playing, and I can hardly hear my friends talking.
The music is going fast, and some people are starting to move to the beat of the song.
Soon all the girls are dancing, but the boys are still standing against the wall. Then the
song ends, and slow music comes on. I don't know what to do, so I just go and stand
against the wall. Then one of the boys in my class comes over and asks me if I would like
to dance to the slow song. I really feel awkward and nervous, but say yes.
We go out into the middle of the gym, and he puts his hands on my waist, and I put my
hands on his shoulders. We start to move to the music, and we step on each other's feet!
He is bigger than me, so my toe starts to hurt a little bit! As we continue to "slow dance,"
more boys and girls come to the middle of the gym to dance together.
It sure is funny to watch people dance because they are stepping on each other's toes
and bumping into each other and turning in opposite directions! Soon the song ends,
and the boys go to one side of the gym again. The girls decide that they want to dance to
a fast song, so they stay in the middle of the gym and dance with one another.
Our teachers are making sure that we are behaving because they are watching us. I
wonder if they want to dance. They probably are remembering their first school dance. I
wonder if someday I'll be grown up just like the teachers and laughing at the memories of
my first school dance? I sure hope so!

Health
Our health is very important to us. People can have good jobs, money or good looks.
However, if they become sick, those things don't mean a thing. It is wonderful to feel
good.
Feeling good isn't just about our body. It is also about our mind and spirit. We need to
feel good in every area of our life.
One of the things we can do to be healthy is to get enough sleep. If we don't sleep well,
or enough, it hurts our body. It is during sleep that our body restores itself.
Everybody knows we should also eat good foods. We need milk products, meats, fruits
and vegetables and breads and cereals. We shouldn't eat too much fat or sugar things
either. Of course, we just shouldn't eat too much at all! Another thing that is very
important is water. Most people know our bodies are mainly water, and we need to keep
that replaced with good water--often!
Exercise is very good for both our body and mind. It is good for our heart, lungs,
muscles and bones. It gets oxygen to our brain to help us think better. It can help us be
smarter!
Doing things that we believe are right and good gives us peace inside. It makes us be
nicer people and is good for our spirit. When we do what we know is right, it helps to
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
50 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
reduce stress, which isn't good for any part of us.
When we take care of our body, mind, and spirit, we feel good all over and inside, too!
What a beautiful world this would be if we could all work at doing these things for
ourselves and also trying to be a help to others!

Halloween (1)
Ghosts, goblins, witches, princes and princesses, kings, queens, skeletons! So may of
these "things" are walking down my street. "Oh, no! They are coming to my door!" The
doorbell chimes, and I slowly open the door. There standing on my front porch, is a little
ghost and a cute little witch. They hold up a bag and say, "trick or treat." I put candy into
their bags and they smile and say, "Thank you."
Every October 31 is Halloween. That is when children dress up as different things (not
just funny people, but things like animals or fruits or vegetables, etc). They go from door
to door and get different candies or little toys from the people in the houses. Some
children, who are not very nice, will do naughty things to houses where people are not
home, like throwing eggs at their windows. I think that is bad.
Sometimes people decorate their houses for this day. Some of the houses can be pretty
scary. They'll have scary noises coming from a tape recorder, too. However, it's only for a
few days out of the year, so we may as well have fun with it.
This year my brother is dressing up as a skeleton, and I'm dressing up as a bride. I am
wearing my mom's wedding dress. It is fun dressing up in costumes and putting on lots
of makeup. Sometimes our friends don't even know who we really are!
The best part of Halloween is the candy, of course. I once got an entire garbage bag full
of candy. Mom and Dad took it away because I was eating too much. Mom gave me a
piece of candy every day, though. If you eat too much candy, you can get a stomach ache.
You need to remember to brush your teeth often, too, so you don't get cavities. Still, that
candy sure does taste good!
Well, it's time to go "trick or treating." So off I go, door to door, getting yummy candy and
hearing people say, "Oh, aren't you pretty!"

New Year's
"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! HAPPY NEW YEAR!"
What is New Year's? Well, to me a New Year is when the date of the year changes. This
year it is 2001, and on December 31 at midnight it will change to 2002. I wonder who
invented the changing of years and how it was made the way it is. It must have been
someone a long time ago, since it's already 2001.
When New Year's comes closer, a lot of people talk about New Year's resolutions. I don't
bother making "resolutions" because I never do them anyway! And the ones that I do
make are usually ones that will happen anyway. I guess it's just common sense.
The biggest reason why I like New Year's is because of the fireworks that we have here in
Canada and many other countries, too. You should see some of the fireworks that go off.
There are many different colours. There's pink, blue, purple, yellow, green, red, even
white, silver and gold. Fireworks make loud bangs, squeals, siren sounds, and
sometimes all at once. There are lots of different sounds, but I can't even explain what
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
51 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
they are all like.
Fireworks are best when it's very dark outside. They light up the whole sky! Sometimes,
they look as though they are going to fall on you.
I like New Year's because it's fun in other ways, but the fireworks are the best part. You
can buy fireworks to use for your own fireworks show. However, you have to be careful
that no one gets burned or hurt.
Usually, there are parties at New Year's. Some people really dress up fancy and even
wear masks. They don't know who one another is until midnight when they take their
masks off. As midnight comes very close, everybody begins to count down, and then
everyone yells out "Happy New Year's" and bang pots and pans or ring bells or honk
horns. Join me in the count down on New Year's Eve. "Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one - HAPPY NEW YEAR!"

More Music
I like music. I have always liked music. Even when I was very young, I liked music. I like
to listen to it, and to make it. When I was a little girl, listening to nice music would
sometimes make me cry! That may seem silly, but the music was so pretty that I cried!
As I grew older, I started to take piano lessons. I was not very good at first, but after a
while I got better. Also, as I grew older, I started to take violin lessons. I did not sound
very good at all at first, but I improved.
When I was a teenager in high school, I made sure I had music classes every year. Those
were the classes I enjoyed most of all. Everyone loved music, and we had a lot of fun. I
started to take private singing lessons while I was in high school, too. I also sang in the
choir, played in a band and acted in plays in high school. The plays were all musicals, so
I got to sing and dance and enjoy music that way also. It was so much fun pretending to
be other people!
When I finished high school, I went to university to learn how to be a music teacher. That
was a lot of fun because every day I was with other people who loved music as much as I
do. Mostly I played the piano, but I also learned how to play the drums, a saxophone, a
trombone, a French horn, a clarinet, a flute, which I REALLY was not very good at, and a
viola. I took more singing lessons, too. We did not have plays to sing and act in, but I
sang in the university choir. Some years, I played the piano for other students who were
learning other instruments. One year, I played duets with another girl who was also there
to play piano. She and I made sure we played fast, funny songs, so we really enjoyed
ourselves doing it.
Now, I am a music teacher. I do not have a lot of students, not as many as I used to have
anyway. I still find it very rewarding. I like to see people who start off not knowing very
much, if anything, and go on to be very good at creating music.
I still love listening to music also. Music makes me happy when I am sad. It makes me
want to dance or sing when I am already happy. Mostly, music just makes me glad that I
am me and that music is alive in me.

Babies
My baby is asleep in my arms. Her soft cheek rests against my chest, while her sweet
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
52 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
breath puffs gently on my skin. Her tiny lips are puckered a bit. Her little eyelids flutter.
I wonder what she dreams about as she sleeps. Does she dream? I have heard her
whimper in her sleep. Sometimes she awakens with a scream. What is so scary in her
little baby dreams? Once I heard her giggle as she slept. Her dreams must have been
sweet that day.
I have had three babies. The one I am holding now is my last one. My other babies are
grown up more and now at school. I love their childish play and laughter. I miss their
baby dimples and their baby sounds and smells.
There is such joy in the birth of a new baby. We hear their first little cry, telling us all is
well with their small world. We feel their newborn skin, wrinkled, soft and slightly damp.
We feel each little limb and are filled with wonder and humility. Life is good as baby takes
its first food from its mother. Family gathers around, each waiting to hold and love this
newest member. Each time the baby cries, its mom worries, and their bond becomes
stronger.
Babies have their own special smell. Some have described it as "milk and innocence." It
is the sweetest smell on earth, I think. It cannot be copied. Somehow, it disappears as
baby grows.
I love to hear my baby talk. Once in a while I can even understand a little bit! She is so
serious in her baby talk that I just have to pick her up and hug her. I love to hear her say
"Mommy."
When my baby is tickled, or when the dog or her big brothers do something funny, it is
so sweet to hear her baby laugh. It's such a cute little giggle! Sometimes she laughs so
hard, her face turns red, tears come to her eyes, and she falls down weak with the
laughter. Those who watch her can't help but laugh, too. I hope she always laughs so
easily.
The parents watch with pride and joy as baby grows and has many "firsts." There is the
first time baby sleeps through the night, rolls over, smiles, laughs, hugs and kisses. Then
there is the first tooth, crawling, first step and first word. With each new first, the baby
becomes less a baby!
These steps are a little sad to parents, too, because they know they're "losing their
baby." However, to a mother, even an adult child is still her baby!
My baby is not perfect. Sometimes she gets mad or whines for no reason. But, to me, she
is still beautiful. Her smiles more than make up for her tears. Her hugs wipe away when
she's been bad. I intend to cherish each moment with my baby while I can!

Bed Time
I am almost nine years old and my bed time is 8:30 p.m. I think that is so unfair! I think I
am old enough to stay up until at least 9:00 p.m. My parents say that I have to go to bed
early because I have school the next day. I can't wait until I am grown up and can stay
awake as long as I want. Even though I think I should be able to go to bed later, I do like
our night time routine.
At about 8:l5 p.m., my Mom sends us up to put on our pajamas. When we come back
downstairs, we read together. Sometimes Mom will read to us, and sometimes we will
read to her. If Dad is not working, he will sometimes read, too. Mostly it is Mom we read
with though. When we read, Mom helps us with words we cannot read. We have to try
and sound the word out, but if we are really stuck, she will help us. If we come to a place
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
53 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
in our reading where we do not understand the meaning of what was written, we stop
reading and look at Mom. She will tell us what it means or help us figure it out on our
own.
After we are finished reading, we say goodnight to everyone in our house. First we say
goodnight to Mom and give her a hug and a kiss. Then we do the same for Dad, then our
little sister, and then our dog! Afterwards, we go upstairs and brush our teeth.
I have to do special stretching exercises for the muscles in my chest and legs, or I get
pains when I run and play. I do my stretching before I get into bed. After my exercises,
either my brother or I turn off the lights. We share a bedroom, so we take turns turning
the light off.
Before we get into bed, we say our prayers. After we get into our beds, my brother and I
talk to each other for a long time. We tell each other about our day, about what we hope
will happen in the future, about our friends and all sorts of other important things. After
awhile, we get so tired, we just fall asleep in the middle of talking!
Even though we go to bed at 8:30 p.m., we talk so long we don't go to sleep until about
l0:00 p.m. I still do not know why I have to go to bed so early when I am not even tired!

Why Do I Like Mathematics?
Sometimes there is a problem in life that has no answer. Perhaps a child has trouble
learning. Perhaps someone becomes ill. Perhaps there was love, but now there is conflict.
These problems are hard to solve. There is no single answer. Many people have opinions
on what is the best answer.
But in mathematics there is an answer: a single answer that is right. There is no doubt;
there is no argument; this answer is right. If we ask, "What is five plus seven?" The
answer is twelve. If we ask, "How do you raise a child?" The answer would depend on the
child and the parents.
Sometimes there is more than one way to reach an answer. Imagine we want to find the
area of a triangle. The triangle has a right angle; the two sides surrounding the right
angle are 20mm and 30mm. The formula for the area of a triangle is one half of
(base)(height). We could consider the 20mm side as the base and 30 mm as the height.
We could consider the 30mm side as the base and the 20mm side as the height. Both
ways would produce the same answer. The area is 300 square mm. Alternatively, we
could consider the base as the third side of the triangle and then we would have to draw
a height and measure it. The height would be neither 20 nor 30. But still we would end
with the same answer. In math, the answer does not change.
Another reason I like math is the way it brings order. There can be a whole set of
numbers or a whole set of measurements that mean nothing until mathematics organizes
them into a pattern. An average number can be found; graphs can be drawn; the spread
of the numbers and probabilities of a certain number happening can be calculated. This
is like having a whole lot of dirty dishes after supper. Applying math is like washing and
sorting the dishes and putting them back into the cupboard.
Math is a powerful tool. Math should be our friend, and we will find more ways to use it to
better our lives.

My Sister's Visit to Canada
My sister had never been to Canada but came for a visit last April. I picked her up at the
airport in Toronto and drove her through the traffic and multilane highways, past the
grape vines and peach trees to Niagara Falls, where I live. She was very tired from the
flight and soon slept.
The first day we walked to see the Falls. The spray from the Falls drifts high into the air
and across the people standing to watch. There are people from all over the world
watching the water and using their cameras. Because it was April there was still ice
beside the water, huge chunks of ice that looked like white rocks. In the river there were
floating pieces of ice moving downstream.
The next day we went to the town where the Niagara River joins Lake Ontario. The
weather was warm. We walked a long way and our feet were hot, so we went down to the
edge of the water to put our feet in. One toe in was enough! The water was so cold it
made our feet ache! A piece of ice drifted beside our feet. I put one foot in for a second
then out, as the pain of the cold went right through me! My sister could not understand
how it could be so warm, but there was still ice.
Another day we went to see my daughter; she is living on a farm an hour's drive away.
We walked through her trees; the buds were starting to turn into leaves. We stopped and
looked at the spring wildflowers. We climbed across a creek by walking over a fallen tree.
We saw the footprints of raccoons by the water. There was fresh air and sunshine and
blue sky.
On the way home we stopped for hamburgers and fries at a drive-through restaurant. She
had never been to a drive-through restaurant before. Then we went to a donut shop.
There are no donut shops where she lives. There was a choice of 20 different types of
donut: some round, some with holes, some with frosting, some with jam inside--each
was different.
The days passed quickly, and soon it was time to take her back to the airport. Some of
the trees now had leaves; some of the tulips were now blooming. It was hard to say
goodbye to my sister. I hope we can visit again soon.

A Summer Sunday
Today the sun was warm; the sky was blue with a few white clouds. It was a good day to
pick strawberries; it was a good day to go to the beach.
I drove to a pick-your-own farm where people can pick their own fruit and buy it. There
the fruit is very fresh and delicious. The owner of the farm gave everyone a row to pick
their strawberries. Everyone was wearing sun hats. I knelt down on the straw between
the rows and picked the big juicy red berries. I tasted one; it was warm from the sun.
When I bit into it the juice was sweet and strong. When three big pails were full, I went to
pay for them and picked up some recipes for some strawberry desserts. I packed two of
the pails in a cooler with some ice, and the other one we would eat at the beach.
I met my daughter at the beach. She had a soft pink blanket on the sand. This beach is
beside a lake, and across the lake about 50 km away the large city can sometimes be
seen. Today the wind blew cooler air across the lake over the people on the beach. There
were children playing in the water. One man helped his son dig holes in the sand, and the
water ran into the holes. One lady held her children's hands and walked down into the

water. Families climbed over the rocks and sat on the last rock where the water was deep.
Teenagers rode bicycles and roller blades along the path beside the beach. Adults
walked and ran along this path, carrying water bottles around their waists
We sat on the blanket and ate sandwiches of meat and lettuce and strawberries from the
pail. We talked and read books and lay in the sun, relaxing. We wore sunscreen, but our
skin was getting hot. How cold was the water? We walked across the sand that almost
burned our feet, to the edge of the water. She went right in and lay down floating. I put
my toes in and felt the chill through my body. I went up to my knees, then my thighs, but
that was far enough! My whole body was cooled down; I headed back to the blanket to
lay in the sun again.
Soon it was time to go home, she was coming to my house for supper. We drove down
the highway with the windows open and our hair blowing in the warm breeze. We cut the
strawberries up and made a strawberry dessert with cake and ice cream. We sat outside
in the backyard under the maple trees with the birds singing around us and ate our
supper. It was a perfect ending to a relaxing summer day.

My Parents
My parents live in England, and I live in Canada. I don't see them often. They used to
come and visit on a plane, and we would pick them up at Toronto airport. But now they
are older and say the flight is too long for them.
I went to visit them last year, with my son, their grandson. They live by the ocean, and we
could hear the sound of the waves through the bedroom window and see the blue water
of the English channel. There is an island with a castle on top in the bay. We walked
many times on the beach and picked up pebbles and feathers. We visited the island and
walked up the steep hill to the castle.
My mother likes to cook. She makes delicious cakes and pies. We went for a hike and
picked wild blackberries. She made them into a pie that smelled so good coming out of
the oven and tasted so good on our plates. She has many cook books with recipes from
all over the world and likes to try new things. She can make pastry very easily and rolls it
with a rolling pin quickly. When I tried to make pastry, it sticks to the rolling pin, it has
holes at the bottom of the pie, and it tastes like a rock! Her pastry is crisp and tender.
My father likes to garden. He grows lettuce, carrots, potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers and
many flowers. When my mother was very ill last year, she had to stay in bed. He planted
roses outside her bedroom window, so she could open the curtains and see them. Their
house has small room with windows all around, and they plant seeds there in winter in
small pots. The warmth from the sun makes the seeds grow, and in spring they are a
good size to be planted outside.
In the house beside them and in the house in front of them, there are older ladies whose
husbands have died. These ladies do not drive, so my father takes my mother and the
two ladies to the town for shopping every week. He helps one find her groceries because
she cannot see well. He helps her take tapes of books from the library so she can listen
to books instead of reading them because of her eyes. He helps them cut their grass and
fix anything that is broken in the house.
I am very proud of my parents; they are over eighty years old and often hurt when they
move around. But still they help other people, and they help each other. They have been
married for over fifty years, but still my father loves my mother enough to plant roses for

Article #82
The Planets of Our Solar System
The planet on which we live is called the Earth. Our planet is constantly moving around
the sun, and each year, the Earth travels all the way around the sun. But there are many
other planets that also travel around the sun. Together with the sun, the planets, and
various other bodies, the Earth is part of our "solar system."
The planet that is closest to the sun is Mercury. Mercury is extremely hot, and it is much
smaller than the Earth. The second planet from the sun is Venus. Venus is about the
same size as the Earth. Venus is also very hot.
The Earth is the third planet from the sun. The Earth is unusual among the planets,
because it has such a large moon. The Earth is bigger than the moon, but the moon is
still quite large. It takes about one month for the moon to travel around the Earth.
The fourth planet from the sun is Mars. Mars is known for its red colour. Mars is smaller
and colder than the Earth. Mars has two very small moons. After the planet Mars, there
are many small bodies called the asteroids. These rocky objects are much smaller than
planets.
The first four planets are all made of rock and metal. The remaining planets, however, are
mostly made of frozen gases.
The fifth planet is called Jupiter. Jupiter is the largest planet. It has many moons that
travel around it, and it also has a large red spot. The sixth planet is called Saturn. Saturn
is the second-largest planet, and it is famous for the wide "rings" that surround it. These
rings are made up of many smaller objects that are found in the same area.
The seventh planet is called Uranus. The eighth planet is called Neptune. These planets
are also gas giants, but they are smaller than Jupiter and Saturn. Both Uranus and
Neptune are so far from the sun that scientists only discovered these planets during the
past few hundred years, using telescopes. The other planets had all been visible to
curious people for many thousands of years.
The ninth planet is called Pluto. Pluto is very small, and it is much more rocky than the
gas giants. Some scientists believe that Pluto is not really a planet at all. They suggest
that Pluto is the largest of many asteroids that are found at the edge of the solar system.
The solar system is a vast place. So far, people have not travelled beyond the moon. But
perhaps someday, human astronauts will visit the other planets of our solar system!

Learning to Drive
Each year, many young people learn to drive a car. For many people, learning to drive is
important because the car is an important method of transportation in many places.
Before learning to drive a car, it is important to understand the rules of the road. A
beginning driver should already understand the many signs that are found along the
roads. Also, the student driver should know the many rules about changing lanes,
turning, stopping, and many other aspects of driving. In addition, the driver should be
familiar with the way the car is operated; it is important to know how to use the lights,
signals, brakes, accelerator, and steering wheel.

When a person starts learning to drive, it may take some time to become skilful. It takes
some practice to become an expert in driving a car. One must become familiar with
steering, speeding up, and slowing down. At first, it is good to practice driving in a large
open space, such as an empty parking lot. Here, one can practice without being a danger
to anyone.
When a person gains some skill in driving, it is then safe enough to practice driving on a
road. Of course, a student driver must still be very careful. He or she should always have
an expert driver in the car with him or her. Many beginning drivers take driving lessons
from professional instructors, who can teach safe driving techniques.
Eventually, the young driver is ready for a driving test, which is needed to obtain a
regular driver's licence. This test is supervised by a government official. In the driving
test, the driver must show that he or she can control the car with great skill by being able
to make turns and to park the car in small spaces. But he or she must also show respect
for the rules of the road by driving at a proper speed, and obeying all traffic signs and
signals.
Of course, even when one has obtained a driver's licence, it is always important to drive
carefully and responsibly!

Article #84
Snow
Snow is the white substance that falls to the ground during cold weather conditions.
Each tiny piece of snow, called a snowflake, is a very small amount of water that has
frozen into an unusual shape. During the winter months, huge numbers of snowflakes
fall to the ground, covering the land in a white blanket of snow.
In many parts of the world, people never see any snow. Snow only falls when there is
moisture in the air, and when the temperature falls below the freezing point of water,
which is zero degrees Celsius. During the winter, snow falls instead of rain.
One advantage of snow is that it allows many fun outdoor activities. Children like to play
in the snow. For example, they may make a "snowman" by rolling snow into a large ball,
and then placing these balls of snow on top of each other, in the shape of a person.
Another fun activity in the snow is skiing. Skis are very long, thin, flat pieces of hard
material that one wears on one's feet. Wearing skis allows a person to slide along the
surface of the snow. People can ski down the side of a hill, travelling at great speeds.
Many people find the sport of downhill skiing to be very exciting. Some people like to ski
along flat ground, often travelling great distances. This sport, called cross-country skiing,
is an excellent way to develop physical fitness.
Of course, snow also causes some problems. Snow can make driving dangerous
because falling snow makes roads slippery, and on a windy day, blowing snow can make
it difficult to see very far. It can also be a lot of work to remove snow from the roads and
sidewalks. Snow is a heavy substance, and it must be cleared away using a shovel or a
large machine.
Many people love the beauty of the land when it is covered by snow. The white covering
of snow over the fields and trees can give a feeling of peace and calm. If you have never
seen snow before, you should someday experience this strange and wonderful
substance!

Christmas
In most Western countries, Christmas is the biggest holiday of the year. People gather
with their families to celebrate this day, which occurs on December 25th each year.
The holiday of Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. In the Christian religion,
Jesus Christ is recognized as the Son of God. During the Christmas season, many
people celebrate the events of the birth of Jesus Christ. For example, they recall the
three wise men who visited Jesus Christ shortly after his birth. Also, they recall that
Jesus Christ was born in a manger (a place where horses are kept), because his parents
could not find a place to stay.
In Western countries, Christmas is also celebrated by many people who are not religious.
People view Christmas as a time for being together with one's relatives. Children, parents,
and grandparents gather to exchange presents and to eat special foods.
The tradition of giving gifts at Christmas is unusual in one way. When children go to bed
on the evening before Christmas, they hang large socks (called stockings) in their house.
When they wake up on Christmas morning, the stockings have been filled with toys and
candy.
According to tradition, the presents have been given by a fat man who wears a white
beard and a red suit. This man, called Santa Claus, flies around the world in a sled that is
pulled by reindeer. He stops at each house and flies down the chimney to deliver his
presents. In the weeks before Christmas, children are usually very well behaved. Their
parents tell them that Santa Claus will only give presents to children who are good!
Another Christmas tradition is the Christmas tree. People put a small tree inside their
house and decorate it with various pretty objects. Nowadays, most people use an
artificial tree instead of a real tree. The tradition of the Christmas tree is actually older
than Christmas itself-the people of Europe celebrated the beginning of the winter season
in this way even before Christianity reached Europe.
Christmas is certainly one of the most important and most enjoyed holidays in Western
countries.

Thanksgiving
An important holiday in North America is held during the fall, or autumn, season of the
year. This holiday is called Thanksgiving. At this time of year, people join with their
relatives to reflect upon their good fortune.
Thanksgiving is a holiday that has a long history in North America. It was first celebrated
when English settlers arrived in the eastern part of what is now the United States, during
the seventeenth century. When they survived the first hard year, they celebrated and
gave thanks to God. They invited some of the Native people to their Thanksgiving
celebration, because the Native people had helped them to survive during the hard winter.
The tradition of celebrating Thanksgiving continued and spread throughout North
America. Each fall, during the time of the autumn harvest, people celebrated
Thanksgiving. They gave thanks for the food of the harvest, and for all the good things in
their lives.
Today, the tradition of Thanksgiving celebration continues. Families gather to eat a large
bird called a turkey. They also eat pumpkin pie. This is a sweet dessert that is made from
a large orange vegetable that grows on the ground.
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. But
the following day, Friday, is also a holiday, and then comes the weekend. In Canada,
Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October. The reason for the earlier
celebration in Canada is that the weather is colder than in the United States. This means
that the harvest happens earlier in Canada, so Thanksgiving is held at an earlier date. But
in both countries, Thanksgiving is a very pleasant time of year.

Halloween (2)
The holiday called Halloween is celebrated on October 31st of each year. Halloween is
not an official holiday. Everyone goes to work or to school on Halloween, just as on any
other day. But Halloween is still one of the holidays that children like the most.
Why do children like Halloween so much? There are two reasons: costumes and candy.
On the evening of October 31st, children dress up in strange and unusual costumes.
They wear costumes that may look like a witch, a monster, or many other weird things.
Putting on these scary costumes is a lot of fun for children.
After the children put on their costumes, they walk from house to house during the
evening. The children carry large bags with them. At each house, they stop and knock at
the door. When an adult opens the door, the children shout "trick or treat." The adult who
opens the door pretends to be frightened, and then puts pieces of candy into each child's
open bag.
At the end of the evening, the children have visited many houses and have collected
much candy. During the next several days, they can feast upon the sweet candies that
they have received.
Another Halloween tradition is very unusual. In each house, a family gets a very large,
round orange vegetable called a pumpkin. They cut a hole in the top of the pumpkin, and
empty out the flesh and seeds of the vegetable. Then, they cut holes in the side of the
pumpkin, so that it appears to have eyes, a nose, and a mouth. When the carving is
finished, the pumpkin looks almost like a person's face!
When the pumpkin has been carved to look like a face, people place a light inside the
pumpkin, so that the vegetable seems to glow in the dark. This strange-looking face is
called a "jack-o-lantern." On Halloween evening, one can see many of these jack-o-
lanterns, some of which are very beautifully carved.
Halloween is truly a fun and interesting holiday, especially for children!

Easter
Traditionally, Easter has been one of the most important holidays of the Christian religion.
For Christians, the Easter holiday celebrates the death of Jesus Christ, who died for the
benefit of all people. The exact date when Easter is celebrated is different each year, but
it is always held in early spring, during March or April.
There are two very important days that make up the Easter holiday, which occurs during
the spring season. The first of these days is called Good Friday. Christians recognize
Good Friday as the day when Jesus suffered and died on behalf of humanity.
The second of these days is called Easter Sunday. Easter Sunday occurs two days after
Good Friday. Christians celebrate Easter Sunday as the day when Jesus rose from the
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

dead and went to Heaven. For Christians, Easter is the most solemn holiday of the year.
Many people attend church services on Good Friday and on Easter Sunday.
Easter is also a time for celebration. Some Easter traditions come from old springtime
festivals that existed even before Christianity. One of the traditions associated with
Easter is the painting of Easter eggs. People take chickens' eggs, make them hollow, and
then paint them with beautiful colours. Some people paint very beautiful and complex
designs on the Easter eggs.
Another Easter tradition is the Easter Bunny. According to tradition, the Easter Bunny is
a magical rabbit that visits the homes of children on the night before Easter Sunday. The
Easter Bunny hides chocolate candies, shaped like eggs, throughout the child's house.
On the morning of Easter Sunday, the children must search throughout the house, to find
these many hidden treats!
The Easter holiday is an important time, both as a religious holiday and as a celebration
of springtime.

My Friends
Two of my best friends are named John and Jane. John and Jane are related to each
other. In fact, they are brother and sister. Not only are they brother and sister, but they
are also twins. Their mother gave birth to them only a few minutes apart.
I first met John and Jane when we were only five years old. We went to kindergarten
classes at the same school. Because the house where John and Jane lived was close to
my family's house, I often walked to school with John and Jane.
When we weren't at school, John and Jane and I often played together. Sometimes, we
would play sports and games. Sometimes, we would play in the forest, looking for birds
and animals. On rainy days, we would stay inside, and play with toys and dolls. On warm
summer days, we would go swimming in the lake that was near the place where we lived.
I often visited John and Jane at their house. On many occasions, I had lunch at their
place. John and Jane's parents were very nice to me. Of course, John and Jane often
visited my house too. My parents enjoyed it when John and Jane came over for lunch.
When I became older, I remained friends with John and Jane. Sometimes, we would
study or do our school homework together. Sometimes, we worked at the same part-time
jobs, to make extra money. We often helped each other in various ways. Sometimes, I did
a favour to help John or Jane, and sometimes they did favours to help me.
Eventually, when we grew up, I moved to a different town. Both John and Jane also
moved to different places. But I am still good friends with John and Jane. Two years ago,
I went to Jane's wedding, and last year, I went to John's wedding. I think I will probably
always be friends with John and Jane.
Having friends is very nice. I am very lucky to have had good friends such as John and
Jane.

Hobbies
Hobbies are activities that people do in their spare time, for the sake of enjoyment. A
hobby usually involves work of some kind, but the work is fun for the person who does it.
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
61 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
Some people enjoy their hobbies very much and like to spend much time on those
hobbies.
There are many different hobbies that people enjoy. One of the most popular hobbies is
gardening. Many people enjoy growing beautiful flowers or tasty vegetables in a garden
near their house or apartment. People who have a garden enjoy seeing the results of
their work, when flowers show their bright, beautiful colours. But gardeners also enjoy
the tasks of gardening itself. They like to work in the soil, planting and watering their
flowers.
Another popular hobby is photography. Some people enjoy taking pictures of the people
and places around them. People who enjoy photography may sometimes buy expensive
cameras that allow interesting photographs to be taken. But even people who have only
a basic camera can still take beautiful pictures.
For many people, car repair is a favourite hobby. Some people enjoy looking at the
engine and other parts of their cars. Those people make repairs or improvements to their
cars. Of course, this is a useful hobby, but many people enjoy "fixing up" a car simply
because they enjoy working with cars.
Some people collect objects as a hobby. For example, some people collect postage
stamps, and some people collect coins. It can be very satisfying to find the missing parts
of one's collection, especially when the stamps or coins are very rare.
Of course, these are just a few of the many hobbies that people enjoy. Do you have any
hobbies that you enjoy?

Life in Outer Space?
People have often wondered about whether or not there is life beyond the planet Earth.
For years, the idea of intelligent life on other planets has been very popular. Many books
and movies tell stories of what those forms of life might be like.
Many scientists believe that very simple forms of life are likely to exist on many other
planets. Under the right conditions, simple life forms might arise. Those conditions,
which include moisture and warmth, might occur in many parts of the universe.
Fewer scientists believe that very intelligent forms of life are likely to exist on many other
planets. For intelligent life to evolve, a very long period of time is needed. During that
time, the conditions on a planet must not be too harsh. Otherwise, the evolving life forms
will die. The amount of water, heat, and various chemicals must be "just right." If not,
then complex life might never evolve.
The conditions needed for intelligent life to evolve are very unlikely to occur on any one
planet. However, some scientists believe that intelligent life might be common in the
universe. Because there are so many stars and planets in the universe, there might be a
few places that have intelligent life. However, those places are probably very, very far
away.
Other scientists disagree. They think that the conditions needed for intelligent life are
extremely rare. Because of this, our planet might be the only place that has intelligent
life!
So far, it is impossible to know whether or not there are intelligent beings on other
planets. But even if those beings do exist, it seems very unlikely that we will ever meet
them.

Reading the Newspaper
I often enjoy reading the newspaper. In my city, there are three different newspapers, and
I look at different newspapers on different days. I find that each section of a newspaper
has some interesting information.
Most newspapers contain several sections that can be easily removed from the rest of
the newspaper. The main section is found at the front of the newspaper. This section
usually contains the most important news from around the world, from around the nation,
and from the local area.
Sometimes the main section also includes some pages that contain opinions about the
news. The editors of the newspaper write an editorial opinion. Other writers provide
many different opinions about current events. Also, some readers of the newspaper write
letters to the editor, in which they express their opinions.
Another popular section of the newspaper is the sports section. This section contains
information about many different sports events. The sports section provides scores and
results from many games and competitions.
Another section of the newspaper contains information about entertainment and the arts.
The arts and entertainment section tells readers about new movies and plays. It also
describes new books, music concerts, and art exhibits.
Most newspapers also have a business section. This section provides information about
new business deals, and about the stock market. Many people read the business section
of the newspaper to gain information and advice about investing their money.
Finally, newspapers usually have a section for classified advertisements. This section
allows people to advertise about things that they want to buy or sell. It also gives notices
about job openings.
Reading the newspaper is surely a good way to keep informed about many different
events in the world around us.

Summer Jobs
In North America, many young people attend high school, college, or university. But
during the summer months, most of those students work at a summer job.
For most students, there are no classes during the months of July and August, and
sometimes none in May and June also. Having a summer job allows students to make
money that they will need during the rest of the year. They need this money because it
costs a lot of money to pay for university or college. Of course, students also want
money to spend on things that are fun, also.
Many students have summer jobs that involve working with children. For example, some
students work at children's camps, where they teach children various skills and games.
Some students work as lifeguards, at swimming pools and at beaches.
Some students do heavy work in their summer jobs. For example, some students find
jobs as construction workers. Other students work in factories, and some students work
on farms. There are other students who find jobs mowing lawns or collecting trash.
Quite a few students work in stores. Some of these students have jobs as cashiers, and
some have jobs putting products on store shelves. Other students work in restaurants,
as waiters or as cooks.
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

Other students work in offices. Some of them work as assistants for other employees.
Their tasks might include typing letters, programming computers, or delivering mail.
Some students enjoy their summer jobs very much, and they find those jobs to be a
pleasant break from studying. Other students do not really enjoy summer jobs, but find
their jobs to be a nice way to make new friends. But nearly all students who have
summer jobs are pleased to have the chance to earn some extra money.

Article #94
Eating Out
Many people enjoy the experience of going out to eat at a restaurant. It is enjoyable to eat
one's favourite foods, or to try some entirely new food. Going out to a restaurant is also
fun because it allows a change from the usual routine of eating at home.
There are many different kinds of restaurants. One popular type of restaurant is the fast-
food restaurant. When ordering fast-food, you must first wait in line at the front of the
restaurant, and then order food from the counter. After paying, the food is quickly
delivered, and you can then take the food to a table, where you can enjoy your meal.
In most restaurants, you don't have to go to a counter to order your food. Instead, you
are taken to a table soon after entering the restaurant. There, a waiter comes to give you
a menu. You can choose your meal from the foods that are listed on the menu. After
ordering, it takes some time to prepare your food. After a while, the waiter brings your
meal to the table. When you are finished eating, the waiter brings the "bill" or "check".
You then pay for the meal, and leave some extra money as a "tip" for the waiter.
In some other restaurants, the waiter does not bring the meal to your table. Instead, after
you are taken to a table, you then go to a counter called a "buffet." There you can select
different types of foods, such as salads, soups, meats, breads, vegetables, and desserts.
After putting the food on your plate, you return to your table. After eating, you can return
to the buffet to get more food.
Other restaurants can be very fancy. They may have beautiful decorations, and they may
have food that is prepared by expert chefs. These restaurants may also serve fine wines
with the food. Of course, these restaurants are very expensive. At these restaurants, it is
often necessary to reserve a table by telephoning the restaurant in advance.
Different restaurants specialize in different kinds of food. Fast-food restaurants may
specialize in hamburgers or chicken. Some restaurants specialize in steak or seafood.
Other restaurants specialize in foods that belong to a certain nationality. For example,
many restaurants specialize in Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Indian, or Thai food.
Eating out at a restaurant can be a fun and tasty experience. What is your favourite kind
of restaurant?

Radio Stations
When I drive in my car, I like to turn on the radio. By listening to the radio, I can enjoy
music and learn the latest news while I am travelling from one place to another. Of
course, you can also listen the radio at home, or even at work. Listening to the radio is a
popular activity for many people, and each city has many different radio stations.
There are many different kinds of radio stations. Some radio stations provide news and
information. Other radio stations have a "talk" format, where listeners can call the radio
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
64 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
station's experts, to discuss political affairs or to ask for personal advice.
Although there are many radio stations that provide news and opinions, most radio
stations are mainly devoted to playing music of some kind. For example, some radio
stations play the songs that are currently most popular, often called the "top 40" songs.
Other radio stations specialize in particular types of music. There are some stations that
play only classical music. Other radio stations mainly play jazz music. Some very
popular radio stations play "hard rock" music. Others specialize in country music. Some
people prefer radio stations that play rhythm-and-blues music. Still other people enjoy
radio stations that specialize in soft, "easy listening" music.
If you have a favourite kind of music, or even if you like to listen to all kinds of music,
you can probably find at least one radio station that you will like.
In addition to news and music, some radio stations provide other kinds of entertainment.
Sometimes, a story from a book will be told over the radio. Occasionally, the words of a
theatrical play may be heard on the radio.
Even in the age of television and computers, the radio has remained an important source
of entertainment and information. People will surely listen to the radio for a long time to
come.

Article #96
Being a Good Citizen
Every society has laws that regulate the way people behave. A good citizen should obey
laws. However, there is more to being a good citizen than merely obeying laws. There are
many other things that people can do to make their society a pleasant one for every
person.
One way to be a good citizen is to be polite in everyday activities. For example, when
passing through a door, a considerate person will hold the door open for a person who is
close behind. Holding doors open is especially important when someone is carrying a
heavy load.
Being a good citizen is very important when travelling on the roads and streets.
Pedestrians, bicyclists, and car drivers should all follow the rules of the road. Bicyclists
should yield to pedestrians, and car drivers should yield to both bicyclists and
pedestrians. Drivers should also allow other drivers to merge into their lanes. Also,
drivers should avoid honking their horns except when this is necessary.
A good citizen will also avoid doing things that interfere with others. For example, a
considerate person does not smoke cigarettes in areas where this might irritate others.
Also, a polite person avoids playing music so loudly that other people will be annoyed.
And of course, a good citizen avoids littering or making a mess.
Other ways of being a good citizen involve greater effort. Some people serve their
community by doing volunteer work of some kind. Other people help by donating money
to a charity. Another way to serve the community is to donate blood. Blood donors are
needed so that there will be enough blood available to help people who are sick or
injured.
Being a good citizen is very helpful for the community, and it also gives a feeling of
satisfaction and pride!

Visiting the Doctor
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬
65 | P a g ewww. irlanguage .com
When people feel sick, they go to a doctor. But sometimes people visit the doctor even
when they are not sick. Doctors can perform a medical "check-up", to find out if a person
is healthy. By performing this physical examination, the doctor can identify any health
problems that might be developing.
During a check-up, the doctor examines your eyes, ears, and throat. The doctor uses a
small flashlight to examine the eyes, ears, and throat. It is important to make sure that
the eyes react normally to changes in light. It is also important to make sure that the ears
and throat have a normal appearance. When the doctor examines your throat, he or she
will ask you open your mouth wide and say "ah".
The doctor uses a stethoscope to examine the patient's heartbeat. The stethoscope
hangs around the doctor's neck. By using a stethoscope, a doctor can hear the patient's
heartbeat very clearly. While checking the patient's heart, the doctor also listens carefully
to make sure that the patient's breathing is normal.
The doctor also checks the patient's blood pressure. Blood pressure is measured by
placing a cuff around the arm. Air is then pumped into the cuff, and this allows blood
pressure to be measured. Having very high blood pressure, or very low blood pressure,
is not good for one's health; it is better to be "in between".
Another part of the examination is a test of the reflexes. The doctor tests the patient's
reflexes by gently hitting his of her knee with a small hammer. If a person has normal
reflexes, the leg will extend suddenly.
Sometimes a doctor may give injections using a needle, as an extra part of the check-up.
These injections, called vaccinations, prevent the patient from developing certain
illnesses.
Medical check-ups can help to maintain health, but people should also maintain their
health by leading a healthy lifestyle.

A Small Town
I grew up in a small town. There were only about two thousand people who lived in the
town where I grew up. When a town is very small, it is also called a village. My village
was surrounded by many farms and many lakes.
The house where my family lived was near the middle of the town. On the street where
we lived, most of the houses were similar in size, but many of them had different shapes
and different colors. Each house was surrounded by a yard, where people grew their
lawn and their garden.
Often, I would walk from my house to the downtown part of the village. "Downtown" is
the area where the stores and shops of a town are located. Because I lived in a small
town, it was a short walk to the downtown area. Along the main street, there were several
different kinds of stores. Some stores sold food, some stores sold clothing, and some
stores sold hardware (or building supplies).
It was also a short walk to the schools in my town. When I went to elementary school, it
would take about ten minutes to walk to the school. Some of my friends lived on the
same street where I lived. Sometimes, we walked to school together.
During the summer months, many people came from the big city to visit our village. The
people liked to get away from the busy streets of the city. They enjoyed the quietness
and the slow pace of village life. They also liked to spend their vacations near the lakes
‫ایرانیان‬ ‫زبان‬ ‫آموزش‬ ‫مرجع‬

that were near the village. People from the city often said that people who live in villages
seemed very friendly.
When I grew up, I left my village, and I went to work in a larger town. But sometimes I like
to go back and visit the place where I grew up.
