## 91 - The Museum.

>*The museum was very interesting.  
There were so many things in the museum that I would need more time to really see everything.  
There were clothes from the past.  
I don't know how people wore some of those things.  
They look like they would be uncomfortable.  
I like to wear my jeans.  
There were things from wars.  
There were bullets, and cannons and even uniforms from the soldiers.  
I don't think that war is a good thing, but it is good to remember the past and honor the people who died for your country.  
There was an old fire truck at the museum.  
This fire truck was pulled by a horse.  
There were some very old photographs of the firemen putting out fires.  
There were rooms in the museum that were set up like an old house.  
There were antique irons and sewing machines.  
The women used to clean the clothes with a washboard.  
There were no modern appliances back then.  
I'm glad that we have electricity and modern appliances.  
The things that we have make life so much easier.  
There were mummies from Egypt at the museum.  
I was fascinated by those.  
There were artifacts from the Indians.  
There were arrowheads and cradles that the babies slept in.  
I tried my best to see everything, but it was almost impossible.  
The museum is a good place to learn about your past.  
I tried to imagine my grandparents using some of the things that were on display at the museum.*

## 92 - The Police.

>*My mother always told me that if I was lost I could go up to a policeman and that he would help me to find my way home.  
I never did get lost, but I always remembered what my mother told me about the police.  
I think policemen look very nice in their uniforms.  
I see police officers drive by in their police cars.  
In my town we even have police officers on bicycles.  
Policemen and policewomen have a job that can sometimes be dangerous.  
They have to catch people who break the law.  
Sometimes, they have to chase people or try to calm people down.  
To be a police officer you need a lot of training.  
It is important to be able to deal with people effectively.  
A police officer came to our school.  
He had a police dog with him.  
The officer showed us how the dog could track down criminals.  
The dog was very smart.  
He could even find things that were hidden.  
Criminals sometimes hide things that they don't want the police to find.  
The policeman told us that he and his dog were partners.  
His dog lives at his house with the policeman and his family.  
Sometimes I see police cars on the side of the road.  
The police stop people who are speeding or are not wearing their seatbelts.  
The police officers warn people or give out tickets.  
Sometimes they even have to arrest people.  
Police officers are just doing their job when they arrest people.  
Some people need to be arrested and put in jail to make it safer for the rest of us.*

## 93 - Pretending.

>*I like to pretend.  
I like to make up things that aren't real.  
I use my imagination.  
I was pretending that I was in a time machine.  
I set the date for a prehistoric time.  
I turned on the time machine, and it buzzed and whirred and spun madly.  
When it stopped spinning, I opened the door and stepped out into a very thick jungle.  
I listened carefully to the sounds of the jungle.  
I could hear strange animal noises, and the leaves were rustling.  
I wasn't sure if I had gone back in time or had just landed in a jungle somewhere in the twenty first century.  
It didn't take me long to realize that I had indeed gone back in time.  
A very strange bird-like creature with a large beak flew overhead.  
I had never seen anything like it in my life.  
I took a few steps out into the long grass and ferns.  
I didn't want to go too far away from my time machine.  
I heard a noise over on my right side.  
There was a man who looked quite different from me.  
He was dressed in an animal skin, and he carried a big stick.  
I didn't want him to see me, so I hid behind a tree.  
He didn't speak any language that I could understand.  
He grunted at someone who must have been in the distance.  
Then, I felt the earth shake beneath my feet.  
I heard giant thumps on the ground as the floor of the jungle shook.  
The man in the animal skin began to run.  
I saw why he was running.  
A giant dinosaur appeared above the tops of the trees.  
It was bigger than anything I had ever seen.  
My heart began to pound in my chest.  
It was coming toward me.  
I ran toward my time machine and jumped in.  
I set the dial for the twenty-first century.  
The machine whirred and buzzed.  
My time machine landed in the twenty-first century.  
I got away just in time.*

## 94 - A Baby.

>*My aunt just had a baby girl.  
We went to the hospital to visit my aunt and to see the new baby.  
My aunt was feeling fine, although she was just a bit tired.  
She walked with us to a big window that had lots of babies behind it.  
She pointed to a crib with a baby in it.  
The baby was wrapped in a pink blanket.  
We all said how pretty the baby looked.  
I couldn't believe how tiny the baby was.  
She was asleep, so we couldn't see her eyes.  
When the baby went home, we went to visit her.  
We heard the baby.  
She was crying.  
My aunt said that the baby was hungry.  
My aunt had a baby bottle full of warm milk.  
She fed the baby with it.  
The baby was happy after that.  
My aunt patted the baby on the back until the baby burped, and then the baby fell asleep.  
I held the baby.  
I looked at her tiny fingers and tiny toes.  
I was very careful with her.  
She opened her eyes and looked at me.  
I spoke to the baby, but I knew that she could not understand me.  
Babies have to learn to walk and talk.  
My aunt changed the baby.  
Babies wear diapers, so they need to be changed often.  
The baby has a lot of toys, but she is still too young to play with them.  
My aunt says that it won't be long before the baby is crawling and trying to talk.  
Babies are cute.  
I have seen pictures of myself when I was a baby, and it's hard to believe that I was once that small.*

## 95 - A Wedding.

>*The church bells are ringing.  
I am inside the church waiting for my cousin to walk down the aisle.  
Today is her wedding day.  
She is a bride.  
The organist is playing a song on the organ.  
We all stand up and watch my cousin walk down the aisle.  
She is arm in arm with her father.  
She is dressed in a long white dress and a veil.  
She looks so beautiful.  
She looks like a princess.  
The man who she is going to marry is standing at the front of the church.  
He is the groom.  
He looks nice too.  
He is wearing a suit, and he has a flower in his lapel.  
The minister says words to the couple which will make them man and wife.  
The bride and groom smile at each other, but they seem to be a little bit nervous.  
The give each other gold rings to wear to symbolize that they are married.  
They kiss each other and walk out of the church as the organist plays joyous music.  
Some of the people in the church cried at the wedding, but not because they were sad.  
Everyone in the church is very happy for the couple.  
A photographer takes pictures of the happy couple.  
We wish them well and look forward to the reception where we will have a dinner, and we will dance and have a good time until it is very late.  
The bride will throw her bouquet of flowers, and it is said that whoever catches the bouquet will be the next bride.  
The next day, the bride and groom will leave for their honeymoon.  
My cousin and her husband are going to Mexico for their honeymoon.*

## 96 - My Dad.

>*My dad is the man whom I respect the most in my life.  
He works very hard to make the money that supports us.  
My mother has a job too, and she also works very hard.  
My dad is the principal of a high school.  
He works at the school all day, and often has to go to meetings at night.  
He deals with parents, students and staff.  
There is always something that he has to deal with.  
He has a lot on his mind.  
It doesn't matter how much work my dad has to do; he always has time for my brothers, my sister and me.  
If I go to him with a problem, he will sit down and discuss it with me.  
He doesn't yell.  
He is always very logical, and he tries to think of the best way to deal with things.  
My dad is a very patient man.  
Once, I spilled some ink on some papers that he was working on.  
I thought that he would be mad, but he didn't get angry.  
He said that it was okay.  
He takes time out to do things with us.  
He has taken my brothers fishing.  
He takes me to the arena to skate, and he helps my sister to write her essays and assignments.  
He always makes us laugh, and he makes us feel like we are very special to him.  
He is a very good father, and on Father's Day I always buy him a card that tells him just how much he means to me.  
I think it is important to have good parents.  
I hope that when I have children I will be a good parent like my parents are to me.  
Parents give children the foundation that they need to live good lives.*

## 97 - My Mother.

>*My mother does so many things.  
She has a job at a dress store; she cooks our meals; she cleans the house; she feeds the pets, and she still finds time to spend with us.  
My mother is always busy, but she says that her favorite time is time that she spends with us.  
My mother works from Monday to Friday.  
When she comes home from work, she makes something for supper.  
We usually do the dishes, so that she won't have to do them.  
After supper, she helps us with our homework, or she sits down to watch television.  
Some nights she goes shopping, and she takes whoever wants to go with her.  
Mothers are a little bit of everything.  
My mother is like a teacher when she helps us with our homework.  
She is like a nurse when she looks after us when we're ill.  
She is like a cook when she makes meals for us.  
She says that cleaning the house is her least favorite thing.  
She says that the house gets dirty again right after you clean it.  
She gets my father, my brothers, sister and me to help her with the cleaning.  
My mother washes all our clothes, and sometimes she irons them if they need it.  
My mother says that there are not enough hours in a day.  
We try to help my mother as much as we can.  
There is a lot of work involved in keeping a home neat and organized.  
Most of my friends' mothers work.  
Mothers are the people who you go to when you need to be comforted.  
Mothers are the people who can make you feel better.  
I'm glad that I have the mother that I have.  
My mother is caring and funny.  
She is fun to be around.*

## 98 - A Surprise.

>*Last Friday my dad came home from work and said that he had a surprise for us.  
We tried to guess what the surprise might be.  
My brother guessed that we were going out for dinner.  
My dad said "no."  
My other brother asked if my father had tickets to a hockey game.  
My dad said "no."  
My sister asked if we were going on a trip.  
My dad said "no."  
My mother knew what the surprise was, so she just stood and smiled at us.  
I guessed that we might be getting a swimming pool.  
My dad said "no."  
We were getting very frustrated trying to guess what the surprise might be.  
My brother asked how big the surprise was.  
My dad said that the surprise was quite small.  
We were not sure what the surprise could be.  
"Will we all like it?" I asked.  
"Yes" my dad replied.  
Every one of you will love this surprise.  
We heard a noise.  
It was a crying noise.  
"Your surprise wants to see you," my dad said.  
He opened the door to the bedroom, and a tiny puppy came running out.  
We were all very excited.  
Our surprise was a puppy.  
It was a little baby spaniel.  
The puppy loved all of us.  
She ran around and licked all of our faces.  
We had always wanted a dog.  
We take turns feeding the puppy and taking her out for walks.  
She is growing quickly and will soon be an adult dog.  
We all agree that the puppy was the nicest surprise that my dad could have given us.*

## 99 - Rhyming Words.

>*Sometimes my friends and I play a game.  
It's something we made up, so it doesn't have a name.  
We like to take words that rhyme.  
We put them together line by line.  
Do you get the picture now?  
We're playing the game, and this is how.  
I might say I like to drive a car.  
I really don't like to go very far.  
If I decide to take a walk, I'd go with a friend so that we could talk.  
Do you see that these lines rhyme?  
Play the game if you have the time.  
We could talk about school or even playing.  
Do you know what I am saying?  
Rhyming words is easy to do.  
It's fun for me; it can be fun for you.  
Just join in and say something or make it into a song that you can sing.  
There are so many words that rhyme with others.  
Like "smile" and "mile" and "mothers" and "brothers."  
I could spend all day just making up these things.  
I could let my imagination fly on wings Up to the clouds and back to my mind.  
There are so many rhymes that I can find.  
There are some words that are hard to find rhymes for.  
I don't use those words anymore.  
I like to choose words that are easy to rhyme.  
Like "cat" and "bat" or "lime" and "time."  
So, give it a try, I know you'll have fun.  
I'll say "goodbye," my rhyming is done.*

## 100 - Homework

>*Sometimes, my teacher gives us homework.  
I don't mind doing my homework except when the weather is really nice, and all my friends are outside.  
On those nights, I'd rather be outside with them, so I try to get my homework done quickly.  
Tonight, I have some English homework.  
We have been reading a book.  
We have to read a chapter of the book and answer the questions at the end of the chapter.  
It is an interesting book, so the homework for this is quite easy.  
My math homework is not so easy.  
I have to do some addition and subtraction.  
I don't mind that, but there are some problems that need to be solved.  
The problems involve addition, subtraction and multiplication.  
I am not too good with numbers.  
I need to work harder on my math.  
I just finished a project for history.  
I had to make a map of Canada with diagrams showing the routes of all the explorers.  
It was an interesting project because I have been to some of the places that the explorers went to.  
I don't have any science homework.  
At school, we are growing bean plants.  
We go in every day and see how the plants have grown.  
We write down all the changes that occur in the plant every day.  
The only other homework that I have is geography.  
I have a map of Canada, and I have to write the names of all the provinces and their capitals on it.  
It won't take me long to do that because I know all the provinces.  
When my homework is all done, I will go outside and play ball with my friends until it is time to come in.  
I am a good student.  
I get good marks because I like school.  
My favorite subjects are physical education, English and history.  
Math is my least favorite subject, but I'm trying to improve my marks in that.*

## 101 - Opposites.

>*Some things are opposites of each other.  
The opposite of black is white.  
The opposite of happy is sad.  
If I am at the opposite side of the room from you, it means that I am at the other side of the room than you are on.  
The opposite of up is down and the opposite of left is right.

It is interesting to see how many opposites you can think up.  
I could say hello, but I think it's time to say goodbye.*

## 102 - Niagara Falls.

>*In my town there is a paperboy who just got an award for his actions.  
This boy delivered the local newspaper every morning.  
One of the people to whom he delivered the paper was an elderly man.  
This man lived alone.  
The paperboy had often spoken to the man, so he knew that the man lived alone.  
The paperboy always left the newspaper in the man's mailbox.  
One morning the boy noticed that the man had not picked up his newspaper or his mail from the day before.  
The boy felt that something was not right.  
All day at school the boy had a feeling that something might be wrong with the man.  
After school, the boy went back to the man's house to see if he had taken his mail and newspapers.  
The newspapers and mail were still in the mailbox.  
The boy knocked on the man's door.  
He could hear a faint voice, but could not hear what the person was saying.  
He tried to open the door, but it was locked.  
The boy knew that something wasn't right, so he went home and called the police station.  
He explained to the police that the man lived alone.  
He gave the address of the man's house to the police.  
The police knocked on the door, and they also heard the faint voice.  
The police got into the house and found the man lying at the bottom of the stairs.  
The man had fallen and broken his hip.  
The man had not been able to get up.  
He had been afraid that nobody would find him.  
He was very grateful to the paperboy for caring enough to get the police.  
The boy got an award.  
The man said that the boy was a hero.  
The police said that the boy was an example of a very good citizen.  
The paperboy and the man are very good friends.  
The man will never forget what the paperboy did for him.*

## 103 - Niagara Falls.

>*I live in Niagara Falls.  
Niagara Falls is a famous place.  
A lot of tourists visit here every year.  
Most of the tourists come to see the waterfalls.  
The waterfalls are very beautiful and powerful.  
At night they shine lights on the falls that make them even more dramatic.

I know just how powerful the falls are.  
It is interesting to discover all the stories that there are about Niagara Falls.*

## 104 - The Library.

>*One of my favorite places is the library.  
I go there to get books for school, and I go there to get books for pleasure.  
I often read mysteries for fun.  
In the summer, I read lots of mysteries.  
I like to sit outside and read.  
In the winter, I have to read books for school.  
I go to the library to find out things for my projects.  
I often use the dictionary and the atlas.  
Some of my friends go with me, and we sit at the tables and do our homework.  
We can't make a lot of noise in the library.  
People have to be quiet when they are in a library.  
When I first went to the library, I was confused about how to find books.  
The librarian showed me how to use the computer to find books.  
Now I am able to do all my research myself.  
I have read some very interesting books.  
I have learned a lot from library books.  
I always bring the books back on time so I don't get a fine.

My mother says that reading is a good habit to get into.*

## 105 - When I Grow Up.

>*I have been thinking about what I'd like to be when I grow up.  
There are so many choices.  
I could be a principal like my father.  
I could be a teacher.  
I like animals.  
Maybe I should be a veterinarian.  
My cat just went to the veterinarian to get her shots.  
I don't think my cat was too happy to be there.  
I could be a farmer and grow vegetables.  
Maybe I could be a doctor and cure people.  
If I was good enough, I could be a famous sports person or a singer.  
I could be an actor on television or in the movies.  
Maybe I would like to be a policeman or a fireman.  
I could rescue people.  
I can play the piano.  
Maybe I should be a musician.  
I could be a lawyer.  
I sometimes watch shows about lawyers defending people.  
Lawyers have to be able to speak well.  
I could be a carpenter and work with wood, or I could be a welder and work with metal.  
There are just so many jobs.  
I could work in a restaurant.  
I could cook food, or I could serve food.  
I could be an airline pilot or the captain of a ship.  
I could be a repairman or an artist.  
The world is full of jobs.  
Some of the jobs require a lot of education.  
Some require a little bit of training, and some require a lot of training.  
It's all up to me.  
I can be whatever I want to be.*

## 106 - Favorite Colours.

There are not a lot of things that are purple.  
Some grapes are purple.  
Sometimes the sky looks purple.

Some things are blue.  
The sky is blue, and water is blue.

Trees are green in the summer.  
Some trees are green all year long.  
Grass is green.

## 107 - Making Friends.

>*I used to be very shy.  
I would not go up to someone that I did not know and say hello.  
I was afraid that people would not want to talk to me.  
I have changed.  
I have become less shy.  
I have learned that making friends is easy to do.  
All you have to do is say hello.  
Most people will respond to a smile and a friendly hello.  
People will begin to talk to you about little things in their lives.  
You will soon realize that you have something in common with that person.  
Whenever I start talking to a new person I find that there is some interest that we share.  
Maybe we know some of the same people, or we went to the same school.  
Often we find that we like the same music or the same movies.  
It is easy to have a conversation with someone once you find a topic that you both can relate to.  
The most important part to making friends is to listen to what the other person says.  
If you take an interest in them, they are sure to take an interest in you.  
I have learned many things from meeting people.  
I have had many fascinating conversations, and I have made a lot of good friends.  
One day a girl came up to me and said that she was lost.  
She couldn't find her way to her English class.  
I said that I was going to that class too.  
I told her to come with me.  
We began talking, and we became very good friends.  
That was a few years ago.  
She is still one of my best friends.  
Just think, if she hadn't been lost we might never have become friends.*

## 108 - Getting Old.

>*My grandfather is getting old.  
When I was younger, my grandfather would carry me on his shoulders, and we would go for a walk.  
Now, my grandfather cannot put me on his shoulders.  
He has a hard time walking, and he uses a cane.  
My grandfather used to have lots of hair.  
Now he is bald.  
His skin doesn't look like it used to.  
It is more wrinkled.  
My grandfather takes more naps than he used to.  
He goes to the doctor's, and he takes pills for his heart.  
I love my grandfather very much.  
I don't like the fact that he is getting older, but my mother says that growing older is just a fact of life.  
She says that we will all get older.  
Sometimes my grandfather forgets things.  
My mother says to be patient.  
I am patient.  
I try to help my grandfather as much as I can.  
I sometimes go for walks with him.  
I help him to walk when he has trouble.  
I cheer him up if I think he might be sad.  
I get things for him, and I even read to him at night.  
He used to read to me when I was little.  
Now his eyesight is bad, and he can't see very well.  
My grandfather tells me stories about when he was a boy.  
The world was a very different place then he tells me.  
His stories are interesting.  
Sometimes I wish we could trade places for a day so that I would know what it felt like to be old.  
My grandfather doesn't complain. 
He jokes about his old bones.  
I spend a lot of time with my grandfather.  
I hope that he is around for a long time.*

## 109 - Time.

>*Time is something that you should never waste.  
Once an hour is gone, it is gone forever.  
You should make the most of every minute.  
Time is a funny thing.  
Some days go by so slowly.  
Those are the days that you do things that aren't fun.  
When you are having fun, time just flies by.  
Time is made up of different units.  
Seconds turn into minutes.  
Minutes turn into hours.  
Hours turn into days.  
Days turn into weeks.  
Weeks turn into months, and months turn into years.  
We measure our lives by time.  
We are very concerned with time.  
Even little children are very conscious of time.  
Little children often want to appear older, so if you ask a three-year-old how old he is, he will often say three and a half.  
Many of our sayings are based on time.  
"Give me a minute."  
"Hold on a second."  
"I'm running out of time."  
"Time's up."  
"I just want an hour of your time."  
All of these are common things that we say, and they're all based on time.  
We are a society that lives by the clock.  
We almost all wear watches, and we glance at our watches a lot.  
Time is something that we can't see, but it is a big factor in our lives.  
How many times a day do you look at a watch or a clock?  
I bet you'd be surprised at just how many times you do.*

## 110 - Amy.

>*Amy was a girl who came into our classroom.  
She had many things wrong with her.  
Amy was in a wheelchair, and she couldn't talk.  
She couldn't make her hands and feet do what she wanted them to do.  
We wondered why Amy would even be in our class, because she really couldn't do much of anything.  
Amy had a teaching assistant who had to stay with her all the time.  
One day the teaching assistant got called away.  
I had to look after Amy.  
I was afraid to look after her.  
I really didn't know what to do.  
I sat beside Amy, and I smiled at her.  
She smiled back at me.  
I never realized before that she had such a nice smile.  
Amy made a noise.  
It seemed like she wanted a crayon that was lying beside her.  
I put the crayon into her hand.  
She had trouble holding it, but eventually she got the crayon into her hand well enough so that she could make marks on the paper that was on the tray in front of her.  
Amy spent a long time making marks on the paper.  
She tried so hard to create whatever it was that she was drawing.  
She worked for a long time.  
I just watched her, and I gave her a lot of credit for not giving up when she obviously had so many problems.  
When she was finally done, she picked up the paper with great difficulty.  
With a look of pride on her face, she handed me the picture.  
It was for me.  
I was very touched that she spent all that time drawing something for me.  
I thanked Amy and smiled at her.  
I told her I loved the picture.  
I still have that picture, although I'm not sure what it is a picture of.  
I learned a lot from Amy that day.  
I saw a brave girl who wouldn't give up.  
Whenever I think my problems are too big to handle, I think of Amy and I remember her smile.*

## 111 - Memories.

>*Somebody once asked me what the most valuable things that I owned were.  
I thought about that for a long time.  
Then I realized that most of the things that I had could be replaced.  
What I would not be able to replace were the photographs that I had of my friends and family.  
Photographs are memories that are captured on film.  
Some of the photographs are of people who are no longer with us.  
I would hate to lose them.  
Memories are precious.  
They are all we have sometimes to link us to days gone by.  
I remember the good times.  
I try to relive them in my mind sometimes.  
I remember the sad times.  
Some of the sad memories are painful, but they are all a part of my life, and I don't want to lose any of my memories.  
People come into our lives and people leave our lives, but most people leave a memory for us.  
I have lots of memories, and when I look at my photographs, the memories come flooding back into my brain.  
I remember what people were like when they were younger.  
I remember vacations that I took.  
I remember days that seemed ordinary at the time, but you never get to relive even the ordinary days.  
Memories are so precious.  
Cherish your memories, and keep them in a place close to your heart.*

## 113 - Places to Live.

>*I live in a house.  
My house is in a town.  
My uncle lives in an apartment building.  
His apartment building is in a busy city.  
My cousin lives in a dormitory in a school.  
He shares his room with a classmate.

Now the criminal lives in prison.

When my parents go on vacation, they live in a motel or a hotel.  
A motel only has one or two floors.  
A hotel usually has many floors.

They like to move around from place to place.  
My friends live in a cottage by a lake.  
My grandfather lives in a retirement home.  
Many people who are about the same age as he is live there.  
I would like to live in a palace.  
I think you have to be a king or a queen, or a prince or a princess to live in a palace.*

## 114 - The Bathroom.

>*There is a bathtub in my bathroom.  
On the wall over the bathtub there is a shower head.  
We have a shower curtain hanging on the rod over the bathtub.  
If we want to take a shower, we close the curtain.  
There is soap and shampoo in the bathroom.  
The soap is used for washing yourself, and the shampoo is used to wash your hair.  
Towels are hanging on racks.

The sink has hot and cold taps.  
There is a plug for the drain.  
When you pull the plug, the water runs out of the sink.  
There is a toilet in the bathroom.  
When you flush the toilet, the water swooshes out of it.  
There is toilet tissue hanging beside the toilet.  
We keep other things in the bathroom too.  
There is a medicine cabinet which holds pain killers, toothpaste and makeup.  
My mother likes to wear a lot of makeup on her face.  
There is also hair spray and gel.  
There are brushes and combs for our hair.  
There are toothbrushes and dental floss for our teeth.  
We only have one bathroom, so we line up to use it.  
It is good to have more than one bathroom in a house.*

## 115 - The Bedroom (End).

>*My bed is nice and soft.  
I have a pretty bedspread on my bed.  
I have sheets and a blanket on my bed also.  
I use two feather pillows.  
My pillows have pillowcases on them.  
My dresser has a mirror on it.  
I have a lamp on top of my dresser.  
I also have some picture frames with pictures of my friends and family on top of my dresser.  
There is an alarm clock beside my bed so that I can wake up on time in the morning.

## 116 - I Want to Dye my Hair Green.

>*Many of my friends have dyed their hair different colors.  
I don't mean normal hair colors like brown or black.  
My friends have dyed their hair orange, purple and blue.  
I told my mother that I would like to dye my hair green.  
I explained to my mother that I would only use food coloring.  
The green would not last forever.  
My mother said that dyeing your hair was a silly fad.  
She said that I would not look good with green hair.  
I said that if I couldn't dye my hair green, maybe I could get a nose ring.  
My mother said "no."    
I said that maybe a tattoo on my arm would be nice.  
My mother said, "no way."    
My mother said that she did some crazy things when she was a young girl.  
She said that she used to iron her hair to make it straight.  
That sounds quite boring to me.  
My friend Joan came over.  
Her hair is dyed bright pink.  
My father said, "nice hair, Joan."    
I don't think that he really meant it.  
My mother says that when I am an adult I can dye my hair whatever crazy color I like, but for now she would like me to leave my hair its natural color.  
I tried to tell her that all my friends were doing it.  
My mother asked, "if all your friends were jumping off a cliff, would you do it too?"    
I said "no."    
I think I'll have to wait to have green hair, but maybe by the time I'm old enough to dye my hair green, I won't want it that color.  
My mother says that fads change all the time.  
One day something might be popular, and the next day it's not in style at all.  
I'll just have to live without green hair for now.  
I wonder what the fad will be next month.*

## 117 - Why Do People Dislike Other People?

>*Some people don't like other people just because they look different.  
I think that is silly.  
I don't think that it is fair to judge someone by the way they look.  
Some people look very nice, but they are mean or cruel.  
Some people look very ordinary, but they are incredibly nice.  
I remember when I was in grade one; I saw a girl across the room.  
She had a mean look on her face.  
I thought to myself that she was probably not a very nice person.  
I stayed away from her, and played with the other children.  
Then, we had to play a game, and the teacher said that she would pick partners for us.  
The teacher picked the girl with the mean face as my partner.  
I didn't think that the game would be much fun at all with a partner who seemed as mean as that girl.  
I walked up to her and said hello.  
The girl's face changed.  
She smiled at me, and she began to talk to me.  
Her mean face disappeared.  
We had lots of fun playing the game.  
We laughed a lot and enjoyed each other's company.  
That girl became my best friend.  
Now when I look at her I see what is inside her.  
Sometimes she doesn't smile, but I know what she is like.  
She is a kind and funny person.  
I have learned that you can't "judge a book by its cover."    
It is not fair to dislike someone just because they don't look like you want them to look.  
You have to get to know a person.  
It doesn't matter to me what color a person's skin is.  
It doesn't matter to me if they are short or tall, skinny or fat or happy or sad looking.  
I judge people by how they treat me, and I try to treat people like I would want to be treated.*

## 118 - The Birthday Gift.

>*It is going to be my father's birthday.  
What can I give him?  
I don't have much money.  
I have looked all through the stores, and I have not found anything that I think he would like, or that I can afford.  
I have thought very hard about what to buy for him.  
I thought that he might like some candy, but my father really doesn't eat many sweets.  
I thought that he might like a new shirt, but he has lots of clothes.  
I can't afford a new car or computer for him.  
I was watching him on the weekend.  
He cut the grass, washed the car, took out the garbage, weeded the garden and watered the plants.  
I got an idea.  
I went to my room and took out some paper.  
I cut out pieces of paper, and I wrote on them.  
I wrote on one piece of paper that I would wash the car every weekend for the summer.  
I wrote on another piece that I would take out the garbage every week for the summer.  
I also wrote that I would cut the grass, weed the garden and water the plants every week for the summer.  
I made a birthday card for my dad, and I put the pieces of paper inside it.  
I went downstairs and gave my gift to my dad.  
My dad thought that the gift was very thoughtful.  
He said that it was a gift from the heart.  
I did all those things for my dad all summer.  
He said that he had a lot of free time because I helped him so much.  
My dad and I are good friends.  
I don't mind doing things for him because I know that he is always there to help me out.  
A good gift doesn't have to be something that costs a lot.  
My dad says that the best gifts are the ones that show how much you care for the other person.  
I'm glad my dad liked his gift.*

## 119 - New Year's Day On New Year's Day people start a new year.  

>*Many people make resolutions.  
They resolve to be better people.  
Some people decide that they will lose weight so that they can be healthier.  
Some people decide to give up smoking.  
They also want to be healthier.  
There are all kinds of resolutions that people make.  
Some people try not to lose their tempers.  
Some people say that they will work harder.  
There are people who try to give up bad habits.  
Every year, my brother says that he will stop biting his nails.  
He stops biting his nails in January, but by February he always starts again.  
That is the thing about New Year's resolutions.  
People seldom keep them.  
Everybody starts out with good intentions, but it is very hard to stick with them.  
I don't make New Year's resolutions.  
I find that I just break them.  
I just work day by day to break my bad habits.  
I know that I eat too many sweets.  
Every day, I just try to resist them.  
I think that every day is a new day regardless of whether it is New Year's Day or not.  
Bad habits are hard to break.  
The best thing is never to start any bad habits.  
I don't know if my brother will ever stop biting his nails, but I know that each January he intends to stop.  
Maybe one of these New Year's Days he'll get over that habit.*

## 120 - If I Could Fly.

>*I sometimes imagine what it would be like if I could fly like a bird.  
Just imagine what it would be like to soar into the sky, flying high above the trees.  
You could stand on high rooftops and never be afraid of falling.  
You would see so many things as you flew over rooftops and forests.  
You would feel incredibly free as you traveled from place to place, not bothered by road signs or traffic jams.  
If I could fly like a bird, I would start from my back yard and travel through town.  
I would look down on the houses and factories.  
When I got tired, I would land in a field and take a nap.  
I would travel above rivers, and follow them as they wound along and emptied into lakes and oceans.  
I would fly above parks, and I would call out to the children as I flew high above them.  
I would dip and dive as I flew.  
I would soar up high and dive down low so that I could almost touch the treetops.  
Have you ever flown?   
I know that you can't fly like a bird, but you might have taken an airplane ride.  
When you're in an airplane, you pass through clouds.  
It is exciting to take an airplane ride.  
I love taking airplane flights.  
I like to look down at the Earth.  
When you are up that high, everything below you looks tiny.  
That's the closest I'll get to flying like a bird.  
But I can still use my imagination and spread my wings and soar high above the world just like a bird.*
