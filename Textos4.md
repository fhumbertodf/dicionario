## 91 The Museum.

>*The museum was very interesting.  
There were so many things in the museum that I would need more time to really see everything.  
There were clothes from the past.  
I don't know how people wore some of those things.  
They look like they would be uncomfortable.  
I like to wear my jeans.  
There were things from wars.  
There were bullets, and cannons and even uniforms from the soldiers.  
I don't think that war is a good thing, but it is good to remember the past and honor the people who died for your country.  
There was an old fire truck at the museum.  
This fire truck was pulled by a horse.  
There were some very old photographs of the firemen putting out fires.  
There were rooms in the museum that were set up like an old house.  
There were antique irons and sewing machines.  
The women used to clean the clothes with a washboard.  
There were no modern appliances back then.  
I'm glad that we have electricity and modern appliances.  
The things that we have make life so much easier.  
There were mummies from Egypt at the museum.  
I was fascinated by those.  
There were artifacts from the Indians.  
There were arrowheads and cradles that the babies slept in.  
I tried my best to see everything, but it was almost impossible.  
The museum is a good place to learn about your past.  
I tried to imagine my grandparents using some of the things that were on display at the museum.*

## 92 The Police.

>*My mother always told me that if I was lost I could go up to a policeman and that he would help me to find my way home.  
I never did get lost, but I always remembered what my mother told me about the police.  
I think policemen look very nice in their uniforms.  
I see police officers drive by in their police cars.  
In my town we even have police officers on bicycles.  
Policemen and policewomen have a job that can sometimes be dangerous.  
They have to catch people who break the law.  
Sometimes, they have to chase people or try to calm people down.  
To be a police officer you need a lot of training.  
It is important to be able to deal with people effectively.  
A police officer came to our school.  
He had a police dog with him.  
The officer showed us how the dog could track down criminals.  
The dog was very smart.  
He could even find things that were hidden.  
Criminals sometimes hide things that they don't want the police to find.  
The policeman told us that he and his dog were partners.  
His dog lives at his house with the policeman and his family.  
Sometimes I see police cars on the side of the road.  
The police stop people who are speeding or are not wearing their seatbelts.  
The police officers warn people or give out tickets.  
Sometimes they even have to arrest people.  
Police officers are just doing their job when they arrest people.  
Some people need to be arrested and put in jail to make it safer for the rest of us.*

## 93 Pretending.

>*I like to pretend.  
I like to make up things that aren't real.  
I use my imagination.  
I was pretending that I was in a time machine.  
I set the date for a prehistoric time.  
I turned on the time machine, and it buzzed and whirred and spun madly.  
When it stopped spinning, I opened the door and stepped out into a very thick jungle.  
I listened carefully to the sounds of the jungle.  
I could hear strange animal noises, and the leaves were rustling.  
I wasn't sure if I had gone back in time or had just landed in a jungle somewhere in the twenty first century.  
It didn't take me long to realize that I had indeed gone back in time.  
A very strange bird-like creature with a large beak flew overhead.  
I had never seen anything like it in my life.  
I took a few steps out into the long grass and ferns.  
I didn't want to go too far away from my time machine.  
I heard a noise over on my right side.  
There was a man who looked quite different from me.  
He was dressed in an animal skin, and he carried a big stick.  
I didn't want him to see me, so I hid behind a tree.  
He didn't speak any language that I could understand.  
He grunted at someone who must have been in the distance.  
Then, I felt the earth shake beneath my feet.  
I heard giant thumps on the ground as the floor of the jungle shook.  
The man in the animal skin began to run.  
I saw why he was running.  
A giant dinosaur appeared above the tops of the trees.  
It was bigger than anything I had ever seen.  
My heart began to pound in my chest.  
It was coming toward me.  
I ran toward my time machine and jumped in.  
I set the dial for the twenty-first century.  
The machine whirred and buzzed.  
My time machine landed in the twenty-first century.  
I got away just in time.*

## 94 A Baby.

>*My aunt just had a baby girl.  
We went to the hospital to visit my aunt and to see the new baby.  
My aunt was feeling fine, although she was just a bit tired.  
She walked with us to a big window that had lots of babies behind it.  
She pointed to a crib with a baby in it.  
The baby was wrapped in a pink blanket.  
We all said how pretty the baby looked.  
I couldn't believe how tiny the baby was.  
She was asleep, so we couldn't see her eyes.  
When the baby went home, we went to visit her.  
We heard the baby.  
She was crying.  
My aunt said that the baby was hungry.  
My aunt had a baby bottle full of warm milk.  
She fed the baby with it.  
The baby was happy after that.  
My aunt patted the baby on the back until the baby burped, and then the baby fell asleep.  
I held the baby.  
I looked at her tiny fingers and tiny toes.  
I was very careful with her.  
She opened her eyes and looked at me.  
I spoke to the baby, but I knew that she could not understand me.  
Babies have to learn to walk and talk.  
My aunt changed the baby.  
Babies wear diapers, so they need to be changed often.  
The baby has a lot of toys, but she is still too young to play with them.  
My aunt says that it won't be long before the baby is crawling and trying to talk.  
Babies are cute.  
I have seen pictures of myself when I was a baby, and it's hard to believe that I was once that small.*

## 95 A Wedding.

>*The church bells are ringing.  
I am inside the church waiting for my cousin to walk down the aisle.  
Today is her wedding day.  
She is a bride.  
The organist is playing a song on the organ.  
We all stand up and watch my cousin walk down the aisle.  
She is arm in arm with her father.  
She is dressed in a long white dress and a veil.  
She looks so beautiful.  
She looks like a princess.  
The man who she is going to marry is standing at the front of the church.  
He is the groom.  
He looks nice too.  
He is wearing a suit, and he has a flower in his lapel.  
The minister says words to the couple which will make them man and wife.  
The bride and groom smile at each other, but they seem to be a little bit nervous.  
The give each other gold rings to wear to symbolize that they are married.  
They kiss each other and walk out of the church as the organist plays joyous music.  
Some of the people in the church cried at the wedding, but not because they were sad.  
Everyone in the church is very happy for the couple.  
A photographer takes pictures of the happy couple.  
We wish them well and look forward to the reception where we will have a dinner, and we will dance and have a good time until it is very late.  
The bride will throw her bouquet of flowers, and it is said that whoever catches the bouquet will be the next bride.  
The next day, the bride and groom will leave for their honeymoon.  
My cousin and her husband are going to Mexico for their honeymoon.*

## 96 My Dad.

>*My dad is the man whom I respect the most in my life.  
He works very hard to make the money that supports us.  
My mother has a job too, and she also works very hard.  
My dad is the principal of a high school.  
He works at the school all day, and often has to go to meetings at night.  
He deals with parents, students and staff.  
There is always something that he has to deal with.  
He has a lot on his mind.  
It doesn't matter how much work my dad has to do; he always has time for my brothers, my sister and me.  
If I go to him with a problem, he will sit down and discuss it with me.  
He doesn't yell.  
He is always very logical, and he tries to think of the best way to deal with things.  
My dad is a very patient man.  
Once, I spilled some ink on some papers that he was working on.  
I thought that he would be mad, but he didn't get angry.  
He said that it was okay.  
He takes time out to do things with us.  
He has taken my brothers fishing.  
He takes me to the arena to skate, and he helps my sister to write her essays and assignments.  
He always makes us laugh, and he makes us feel like we are very special to him.  
He is a very good father, and on Father's Day I always buy him a card that tells him just how much he means to me.  
I think it is important to have good parents.  
I hope that when I have children I will be a good parent like my parents are to me.  
Parents give children the foundation that they need to live good lives.*

## 97 My Mother.

>*My mother does so many things.  
She has a job at a dress store; she cooks our meals; she cleans the house; she feeds the pets, and she still finds time to spend with us.  
My mother is always busy, but she says that her favorite time is time that she spends with us.  
My mother works from Monday to Friday.  
When she comes home from work, she makes something for supper.  
We usually do the dishes, so that she won't have to do them.  
After supper, she helps us with our homework, or she sits down to watch television.  
Some nights she goes shopping, and she takes whoever wants to go with her.  
Mothers are a little bit of everything.  
My mother is like a teacher when she helps us with our homework.  
She is like a nurse when she looks after us when we're ill.  
She is like a cook when she makes meals for us.  
She says that cleaning the house is her least favorite thing.  
She says that the house gets dirty again right after you clean it.  
She gets my father, my brothers, sister and me to help her with the cleaning.  
My mother washes all our clothes, and sometimes she irons them if they need it.  
My mother says that there are not enough hours in a day.  
We try to help my mother as much as we can.  
There is a lot of work involved in keeping a home neat and organized.  
Most of my friends' mothers work.  
Mothers are the people who you go to when you need to be comforted.  
Mothers are the people who can make you feel better.  
I'm glad that I have the mother that I have.  
My mother is caring and funny.  
She is fun to be around.*

## 98 A Surprise.

>*Last Friday my dad came home from work and said that he had a surprise for us.  
We tried to guess what the surprise might be.  
My brother guessed that we were going out for dinner.  
My dad said "no."  
My other brother asked if my father had tickets to a hockey game.  
My dad said "no."  
My sister asked if we were going on a trip.  
My dad said "no."  
My mother knew what the surprise was, so she just stood and smiled at us.  
I guessed that we might be getting a swimming pool.  
My dad said "no."  
We were getting very frustrated trying to guess what the surprise might be.  
My brother asked how big the surprise was.  
My dad said that the surprise was quite small.  
We were not sure what the surprise could be.  
"Will we all like it?" I asked.  
"Yes" my dad replied.  
Every one of you will love this surprise.  
We heard a noise.  
It was a crying noise.  
"Your surprise wants to see you," my dad said.  
He opened the door to the bedroom, and a tiny puppy came running out.  
We were all very excited.  
Our surprise was a puppy.  
It was a little baby spaniel.  
The puppy loved all of us.  
She ran around and licked all of our faces.  
We had always wanted a dog.  
We take turns feeding the puppy and taking her out for walks.  
She is growing quickly and will soon be an adult dog.  
We all agree that the puppy was the nicest surprise that my dad could have given us.*

## 99 Rhyming Words.

>*Sometimes my friends and I play a game.  
It's something we made up, so it doesn't have a name.  
We like to take words that rhyme.  
We put them together line by line.  
Do you get the picture now?  
We're playing the game, and this is how.  
I might say I like to drive a car.  
I really don't like to go very far.  
If I decide to take a walk, I'd go with a friend so that we could talk.  
Do you see that these lines rhyme?  
Play the game if you have the time.  
We could talk about school or even playing.  
Do you know what I am saying?  
Rhyming words is easy to do.  
It's fun for me; it can be fun for you.  
Just join in and say something or make it into a song that you can sing.  
There are so many words that rhyme with others.  
Like "smile" and "mile" and "mothers" and "brothers."  
I could spend all day just making up these things.  
I could let my imagination fly on wings Up to the clouds and back to my mind.  
There are so many rhymes that I can find.  
There are some words that are hard to find rhymes for.  
I don't use those words anymore.  
I like to choose words that are easy to rhyme.  
Like "cat" and "bat" or "lime" and "time."  
So, give it a try, I know you'll have fun.  
I'll say "goodbye," my rhyming is done.*

## 100 Homework

>*Sometimes, my teacher gives us homework.  
I don't mind doing my homework except when the weather is really nice, and all my friends are outside.  
On those nights, I'd rather be outside with them, so I try to get my homework done quickly.  
Tonight, I have some English homework.  
We have been reading a book.  
We have to read a chapter of the book and answer the questions at the end of the chapter.  
It is an interesting book, so the homework for this is quite easy.  
My math homework is not so easy.  
I have to do some addition and subtraction.  
I don't mind that, but there are some problems that need to be solved.  
The problems involve addition, subtraction and multiplication.  
I am not too good with numbers.  
I need to work harder on my math.  
I just finished a project for history.  
I had to make a map of Canada with diagrams showing the routes of all the explorers.  
It was an interesting project because I have been to some of the places that the explorers went to.  
I don't have any science homework.  
At school, we are growing bean plants.  
We go in every day and see how the plants have grown.  
We write down all the changes that occur in the plant every day.  
The only other homework that I have is geography.  
I have a map of Canada, and I have to write the names of all the provinces and their capitals on it.  
It won't take me long to do that because I know all the provinces.  
When my homework is all done, I will go outside and play ball with my friends until it is time to come in.  
I am a good student.  
I get good marks because I like school.  
My favorite subjects are physical education, English and history.  
Math is my least favorite subject, but I'm trying to improve my marks in that.*

## 101 I Want to Dye my Hair Green

>*Many of my friends have dyed their hair different colors.  
I don't mean normal hair colors like brown or black.  
My friends have dyed their hair orange, purple and blue.
I told my mother that I would like to dye my hair green.  
I explained to my mother that I would only use food coloring.  
The green would not last forever.  
My mother said that dyeing your hair was a silly fad.  
She said that I would not look good with green hair.  
I said that if I couldn't dye my hair green, maybe I could get a nose ring.
My mother said "no."  
I said that maybe a tattoo on my arm would be nice.  
My mother said, "no way."  
My mother said that she did some crazy things when she was a young girl.  
She said that she used to iron her hair to make it straight.  
That sounds quite boring to me.  
My friend Joan came over.  
Her hair is dyed bright pink.  
My father said, "nice hair, Joan."  
I don't think that he really meant it.  
My mother says that when I am an adult I can dye my hair whatever crazy color I like, but for now she would like me to leave my hair its natural color.  
I tried to tell her that all my friends were doing it.  
My mother asked, "if all your friends were jumping off a cliff, would you do it too?"  
I said "no."  
I think I'll have to wait to have green hair, but maybe by the time I'm old enough to dye my hair green, I won't want it that color.  
My mother says that fads change all the time.  
One day something might be popular, and the next day it's not in style at all.  
I'll just have to live without green hair for now.  
I wonder what the fad will be next month.*

## 102 Why Do People Dislike Other People?

>*Some people don't like other people just because they look different.  
I think that is silly.  
I don't think that it is fair to judge someone by the way they look.  
Some people look very nice, but they are mean or cruel.
Some people look very ordinary, but they are incredibly nice.  
I remember when I was in grade one; I saw a girl across the room.  
She had a mean look on her face.  
I thought to myself that she was probably not a very nice person.  
I stayed away from her, and played with the other children.  
Then, we had to play a game, and the teacher said that she would pick partners for us.  
The teacher picked the girl with the mean face as my partner.  
I didn't think that the game would be much fun at all with a partner who seemed as mean as that girl.  
I walked up to her and said hello.  
The girl's face changed.  
She smiled at me, and she began to talk to me.  
Her mean face disappeared.  
We had lots of fun playing the game.  
We laughed a lot and enjoyed each other's company.  
That girl became my best friend.  
Now when I look at her I see what is inside her.  
Sometimes she doesn't smile, but I know what she is like.  
She is a kind and funny person.  
I have learned that you can't "judge a book by its cover."  
It is not fair to dislike someone just because they don't look like you want them to look.  
You have to get to know a person.  
It doesn't matter to me what color a person's skin is.  
It doesn't matter to me if they are short or tall, skinny or fat or happy or sad looking.  
I judge people by how they treat me, and I try to treat people like I would want to be treated.*

## 103 The Birthday Gift

>*It is going to be my father's birthday.  
What can I give him? I don't have much money.  
I have looked all through the stores, and I have not found anything that I think he would like, or that I can afford.
I have thought very hard about what to buy for him.  
I thought that he might like some candy, but my father really doesn't eat many sweets.  
I thought that he might like a new shirt, but he has lots of clothes.
I can't afford a new car or computer for him.  
I was watching him on the weekend.  
He cut the grass, washed the car, took out the garbage, weeded the garden and watered the plants.  
I got an idea.  
I went to my room and took out some paper.  
I cut out pieces of paper, and I wrote on them.  
I wrote on one piece of paper that I would wash the car every weekend for the summer.  
I wrote on another piece that I would take out the garbage every week for the summer.  
I also wrote that I would cut the grass, weed the garden and water the plants every week for the summer.  
I made a birthday card for my dad, and I put the pieces of paper inside it.  
I went downstairs and gave my gift to my dad.  
My dad thought that the gift was very thoughtful.  
He said that it was a gift from the heart.  
I did all those things for my dad all summer.  
He said that he had a lot of free time because I helped him so much.  
My dad and I are good friends.  
I don't mind doing things for him because I know that he is always there to help me out.  
A good gift doesn't have to be something that costs a lot.  
My dad says that the best gifts are the ones that show how much you care for the other person.  
I'm glad my dad liked his gift.*

## 104 New Year's Day On New Year's Day people start a new year.  

>*Many people make resolutions.  
They resolve to be better people.  
Some people decide that they will lose weight so that they can be healthier.  
Some people decide to give up smoking.
They also want to be healthier.  
There are all kinds of resolutions that people make.  
Some people try not to lose their tempers.  
Some people say that they will work harder.  
There are people who try to give up bad habits.  
Every year, my brother says that he will stop biting his nails.  
He stops biting his nails in January, but by February he always starts again.  
That is the thing about New Year's resolutions.  
People seldom keep them.  
Everybody starts out with good intentions, but it is very hard to stick with them.  
I don't make New Year's resolutions.  
I find that I just break them.  
I just work day by day to break my bad habits.  
I know that I eat too many sweets.  
Every day, I just try to resist them.  
I think that every day is a new day regardless of whether it is New Year's Day or not.
Bad habits are hard to break.  
The best thing is never to start any bad habits.  
I don't know if my brother will ever stop biting his nails, but I know that each January he intends to stop.  
Maybe one of these New Year's Days he'll get over that habit.*

## 105 If I Could Fly

>*I sometimes imagine what it would be like if I could fly like a bird.  
Just imagine what it would be like to soar into the sky, flying high above the trees.  
You could stand on high rooftops and never be afraid of falling.  
You would see so many things as you flew over rooftops and forests.  
You would feel incredibly free as you traveled from place to place, not bothered by road signs or traffic jams.  
If I could fly like a bird, I would start from my back yard and travel through town.  
I would look down on the houses and factories.  
When I got tired, I would land in a field and take a nap.  
I would travel above rivers, and follow them as they wound along and emptied into lakes and oceans.  
I would fly above parks, and I would call out to the children as I flew high above them.  
I would dip and dive as I flew.  
I would soar up high and dive down low so that I could almost touch the treetops.  
Have you ever flown? 
I know that you can't fly like a bird, but you might have taken an airplane ride.  
When you're in an airplane, you pass through clouds.  
It is exciting to take an airplane ride.  
I love taking airplane flights.  
I like to look down at the Earth.  
When you are up that high, everything below you looks tiny.  
That's the closest I'll get to flying like a bird.  
But I can still use my imagination and spread my wings and soar high above the world just like a bird.* 

## 106 What I Look for in a Friend

>*What is it that makes somebody your friend? Some people are nice, and you have fun with them.  
Some people are nice to talk to, but they don't become special to you.  
Some people become very close to you.  
Those people are the ones who become your good friends.  
Did you ever wonder why certain people do become your good friends? Friends usually have something in common.  
Often, friends enjoy doing the same things as each other.  
Maybe they like the same sports, or the same music, or maybe they can even talk about problems or schoolwork.  
Friends usually find a common bond.
Friends share ideas and listen to each other.  
Sometimes, people who don't have similar interests even become friends.  
You can learn a lot from a person who likes different things than you.  
The most important thing about friends is that they must communicate with each other.  
A good friend is a person who takes the time to listen to the other person.  
One of the most important things that I think a friend should have is a sense of humor.  
I like to laugh with my friends.  
I like to feel comfortable around my friends.  
It is nice to be able to talk and laugh with people who have similar interests.  
It is nice to share things with people and learn about their interests.  
You become a better person if you are able to learn things from others.  
Life is a journey.  
On that journey you meet many people.  
Some of those people will change your life.  
You have to choose your friends with care.  
A good friend is worth more than all the gold in the world.  
A good friend will make your journey through life more pleasant.  
Make friends along the way, and the path through life will be very rewarding.*

## 107 A Funny Thing Happened on the way to School

>*Last Friday it was very windy.  
I was walking down the street with my friend John.  
We were having a difficult time walking against the wind.  
The wind was pushing against us, and we felt the force of it pressing against us.  
We even had a hard time breathing.  
We were walking slowly.  
We watched the leaves as they danced and twirled in the wind.  
We watched a plastic bag as it flew by us.  
We saw a little boy whose baseball cap flew right off his head.  
His cap flew along the sidewalk, and he had to chase it.  
He finally caught it, and he held it in his hands tightly after he got it back.  
The trees were swaying frantically.  
Their branches swished and waved in the wild wind.  
John and I were hit by flying bits of paper and leaves.  
We laughed when a garbage can lid rolled along and hit John in the leg.  
We saw another garbage can rolling along the road as if it was alive.  
Everything was moving because of the wind.  
Then, the funniest thing happened.  
I wasn't paying any attention, and a paper bag came flying up the street toward us.  
It hit me right in the face and covered my whole face.  
At first, I didn't know what had happened.  
I was blinded.  
I couldn't see where I was going.  
I stopped and held out my hands.  
When I stopped, the bag fell off my face.  
I looked at John.
He was laughing very hard.  
He was laughing so hard that tears were rolling down his cheeks.  
He said that I looked very funny with the brown paper bag stuck to my face.  
I started to laugh too.  
We laughed about it all the way to school.  
John said that he wished he had a camera.  
He would have taken a picture of me with the bag on my face.* 

## 108 Advice

>*Sometimes my mother gives me advice.  
She tells me to save my money for a rainy day.  
She says that I should eat my vegetables if I want to be strong when I grow up.  
She says that you reap what you sow.  
I didn't know what that one meant, so I asked her.  
She said that if you are good to people, they will be good to you.  
If you do bad things, then bad things will come back to you.  
My mother is always giving me advice.  
She says that a penny saved is a penny earned.  
I am still thinking about that one.  
Some of these things are difficult to understand.  
My mother is very wise.  
She says that she has learned from her mistakes.  
She tells me that she would like me not to make mistakes, but she says that everyone does make mistakes.  
The important thing is that we learn from our mistakes.  
My mother says that nobody is perfect.  
My mother tells my sister that time is precious.  
My sister wastes time, and my mother doesn't like that.  
My mother tells me to be true to myself.  
She says that I should not follow the crowd.  
I should listen to my own conscience and do what I think is right.  
She says that it doesn't matter if you fail at something, the important thing is that you try.  
If you've done your best, then that is all that matters.  
I listen to my mother.  
I think she gives very good advice.  
My mother has a lot of common sense.  
I hope I am as wise as she is when I have children of my own.  
Sometimes I wish that she would not give me so much advice.  
I think that I know what I'm doing.  
But, in the end, I always remember what she has said, and I try to live by the standards that she has set for me.  
Take the advice that your parents give you.  
They only have your best interests at heart.*

## 109 A Trip to the Hospital

>*I have to get my tonsils out.  
I'm not really happy about it, but I'm tired of being sick and having sore throats.  
I have to go to the hospital two hours before my surgery.  
My mother will go with me.  
The nurses will take my temperature and check my blood pressure.  
They will make sure that I am ready for my operation.  
I will be dressed in a white gown, and I will be wheeled down the hall to the operating room.  
I can't have anything to eat or drink for a long time before my surgery.  
My mother will walk down the hall with me; then she will wave goodbye as they wheel me into the operating room.  
The doctor and the nurses will be busy in the operating room.  
They will be getting ready to perform my surgery.  
The doctor will say hello to me and tell me that he is going to put me to sleep.  
He will put something into my arm.  
He will tell me to count backwards from ten.  
I think that I will only say "ten, nine," and then I will be fast asleep.  
I won't be awake for the surgery.  
When I wake up, I will be surprised that the surgery is over.  
My throat will hurt, and I probably won't feel very good.  
My mother will be there with me.  
The nurses will give me a drink and try to make me comfortable.  
I won't be in the hospital overnight.  
I will go home later in the day.  
My parents will have to make sure that I have a lot to drink.  
I can't eat any hard foods or they will hurt my throat.  
I will sleep a lot, because I will not feel very well for a couple of days.  
It won't take long before I recover from my surgery.  
Sometimes, we need surgery to make us feel better.  
Hospitals can be a bit frightening, but the doctors and nurses are very nice, and their job is to make you better.*

## 110 What My Cat Did

>*One day I was sitting in a chair drinking a cup of tea.  
My cat came into the room and sat on my lap.  
She was quite content, and she sat there purring.  
My cat likes to drink water, and sometimes she drinks milk.  
I would never give her tea to drink.
Cats just don't drink tea.  
We were sitting there quietly when suddenly my cat stood up.  
She was looking at something on the floor.  
She crouched down low and got ready to pounce.  
It was a huge centipede.  
I think that centipedes are ugly.  
They have many legs, and they move very fast.
I would hate to have one crawl over me.  
I was surprised that she caught the centipede.  
She put her paw on it, and then she reached down and ate the centipede.  
The centipede must not have tasted very good.  
My cat got a funny look on her face, and she looked like she was trying to get a bad taste out of her mouth.  
I was thinking that I would be sick if I ate a centipede.  
My cat looked at me and jumped back up in my chair.  
She stuck her face in my teacup and took a big drink of tea.  
I was shocked.  
I had never seen a cat drink tea before.  
I think that the centipede must have tasted so bad that my cat just needed something to wash the taste out of her mouth Guess what? I didn't finish my tea.  
I threw it out and washed out the cup.  
My cat has never had a drink of tea since that day.  
She has also never eaten another centipede.  
If a centipede walks by, she just pretends that she doesn't see it.*

## 111 If I Was Tiny

>*Imagine what life would be like if you were two inches tall.  
You would have to be careful that nobody stepped on you.  
You would have to watch out for cats, dogs and birds.  
It would be very dangerous, but just think of the things that you could do.  
You could live in dollhouse, or even a shoebox.
You could use a bottle cap for a plate.  
You would have to wear dolls' clothes.  
A stamp would make a lovely picture to hang on your wall.  
You could hide in a mouse hole or a drawer.  
You wouldn't need much food.  
You could probably live comfortably on the crumbs that people would leave on the table.  
A thimble would make a good cup.  
If you went outside, the grass would seem like a jungle.  
An insect would be huge and frightening.  
A puddle would seem to be an ocean.  
You could cross the puddle in a paper cup and use a spoon for an oar.  
A matchbox would make a good bed with a handkerchief as a bedspread.  
You'd brush your hair with a toothbrush, but you'd never find anything small enough to brush your teeth with.  
You could take a ride on the back of a mouse.  
You wouldn't find any books that were small enough to read, but you might read the back of a pill bottle.  
You could ride in a toy car and have a soup bowl for a swimming pool.  
A leaf could be your umbrella, and a mitten would make a great sleeping bag.  
If you used your imagination, you could think up something to use for almost all your purposes.  
Being small might be fun, but then again, it would be frightening.  
I'd be afraid of my pet cat.  
I wouldn't want a book to fall on me.  
I would be afraid of being swept away by a big gust of wind.  
I think I'd rather be my size.*

## 112 Do People Have the Right to Smoke in Public?

>*My father used to smoke.  
He got very ill.  
The doctor told him that he had to quit smoking.  
My father tried for a long time to quit.  
It was very difficult for him.
Smoking is an addiction.  
After many months, my father finally gave up smoking, but he still craved a cigarette once in a while.  
He says that quitting smoking is the hardest thing that he has ever done.  
When my father did smoke, he smoked everywhere.  
He smoked in restaurants, stores and many public buildings.  
Now, you are not allowed to smoke in a lot of public places.  
When my father smoked, the rules were not so strict.  
People could smoke just about anywhere.  
It really wasn't fair to the people who didn't smoke.  
Their clothes always smelled like smoke, and they breathed in second-hand smoke.  
Some people think that second-hand smoke is actually worse for you than if you smoke yourself.  
People would smoke in their houses, and very young children would inhale the smoke that was in the air.  
Some people still smoke in their houses, and their children breathe in the smoke.  
Some restaurants have areas for smokers and nonsmokers, but usually the smoke drifts from one area to the other.  
There are some businesses that have banned smoking altogether.  
Personally, I think that smoking in public places should be completely banned.  
I don't think that I should have to breathe in another person's smoke if I choose not to smoke myself.  
It wouldn't be fair for a nonsmoker to get lung cancer because they had to be in a place where smokers were allowed to light up.  
I know that smoking is a powerful addiction and that it is very difficult to quit, but smokers should restrict their smoking to places where there is nobody else around.  
Lung cancer is an awful disease.  
Nobody should have to suffer with lung cancer.  
People should be educated about the dangers of smoking.  
Smoking should be banned in public places, but eventually I would like to believe that fewer people will smoke.  
It would be nice to live in a smoke free environment.*

## 113 If I were a Giant

>*If I were a giant, I wouldn't be able to fit in my house.  
I'd have to live in a building that had a high ceiling, but I'd probably have a hard time getting through the door.  
I'd have to make my own clothes, but where would I get a giant needle and thread to sew with? I couldn't ride in a car or a plane.  
I suppose I would just have to take giant steps to get from place to place.  
I would have to be very careful not to step on anybody or anything.  
When I talked, people would cover their ears.  
My voice would sound very loud to them.  
I wouldn't find shoes to cover my feet.  
I wouldn't find a knife and fork to eat my dinner with.  
I might have to use a rake as a fork.  
My dinner would be huge.  
What would I cook my dinner in? 
I certainly wouldn't find an oven big enough to put my dinner in.  
If I sneezed, it would be like a hurricane.  
If I fell down, it would be like an earthquake.  
I wouldn't have any friends because everyone would be too tiny for me to talk to.  
I think that being a giant would be very lonely.  
I couldn't have just one apple.  
I would have to have a lot of apples to fill me up.  
I would have to drink gallons and gallons of water to quench my thirst.  
I could never relax under a tree.  
I would be taller than all the trees.   
I don't think that being a giant would be fun.  
I won't ever make a wish to be a giant.  
I would rather be my height.  
I'm very happy the way I am.*

## 114 Superstitions

>*I am not superstitious, are you? Yesterday was Friday the thirteenth.  
Some people think that Friday the thirteenth is an unlucky day.  
I think that it is just like any other day.  
Some people believe that if a black cat crosses your path, you will have bad luck.  
I don't believe that either.  
My mother always gets upset if I open an umbrella in the house.  
She says that it is bad luck.  
She is probably right about that one because an open umbrella would take up a lot of space, and you might knock things over.  
If your left hand is itchy, you are supposed to get money.  
I have had an itchy left hand before, but I haven't received any money because of it.  
It is bad luck to walk under a ladder.  
This is probably true because you might knock somebody off the ladder, or have a can of paint fall on top of you.  
If you are acting in a play, it is bad luck if someone says "good luck" to you.  
This is very confusing.  
You are supposed to tell an actor to "break a leg." 
It doesn't mean that you want the actor to break his leg.  
It means good luck to the actor.  
Actors have a lot of superstitions that are very unusual.  
I am not superstitious.  
I don't believe in superstitions at all.  
It is just fun to learn about superstitions.  
Some of them are very old and have been passed down from generation to generation.  
I once did a project at school on superstitions.  
It was a very interesting topic, and I got a good mark for it.*

## 115 My Favorite Bedtime Story

>*Every night when I was little, my mother would read me a bedtime story.  
My favorite story was Tom's Midnight Garden.  
This was a story by Philippa Pearce.  
It was quite a long book, and it took quite a few nights for my mother to read the entire book to me.
In Tom's Midnight Garden Tom moves to the city to stay with his aunt and uncle.
He is very bored at their apartment.  
They have no children, so Tom has nothing to do.  
One night, the clock strikes thirteen times.
Tom knows that this is impossible.  
A clock can only strike up to twelve times.  
He sneaks downstairs and goes outside.
When he gets outside, there is a wonderful garden that wasn't there the day before.
The next day, Tom goes outside and finds that there is no garden.  
The garden only seems to appear at night.  
Every night, Tom slips out to this wonderful garden, and he meets some people in the garden.
He meets a girl named Hattie.  
Hattie and Tom become very good friends in this garden.  
Some very strange things happen in this book.  
There are some coincidences that keep you guessing about what is really going on.  
The surprise ending is wonderful.  
I really enjoyed Tom's Midnight Garden and I was very sad when my mother and I came to the end of the book.  
I felt that I had visited the magical garden with Tom.  
It is a book that I will remember all of my life.*

## 116 If I Found a Magic Lamp

>*If I was walking down the beach on day, and I happened to bump my toe on a magic lamp, I would pick it up and rub it.  
If it was a real magic lamp (but I don't believe that there really is a magic lamp), a genie would pop out in a cloud of smoke, and he would call me master.
He would say that he would grant me three wishes.  
I would have to think very hard about those wishes because I wouldn't want to waste them.  
I don't think I'd want millions of dollars.  
Money doesn't buy happiness, or so they say.  
I might wish for good health, because if your health isn't good you won't be able to enjoy anything.  
Some people might wish for beauty, but beauty is only skin deep.  
Some people would wish for a mansion, or a beautiful car or a big boat.  
I don't want any of those things.  
Some people would want fame.  
Some people would want talent.  
Some people would wish for happiness.  
That might be a good thing to wish for.  
Yes, maybe I'd wish for health and happiness, but what would my third wish be? I could wish for something enormous, something global.  
I could wish for world peace.  
That would be a wonderful thing if somebody could grant me that.  
Yes, that would probably be my third wish.  
It's too bad there aren't any genies inside magic lamps.  
I won't get my three wishes.  
I can still work toward getting my wishes.  
I can eat well and exercise to stay healthy.  
I can be involved with a lot of things and be with my friends to stay happy.  
I can volunteer my time to different organizations to help achieve world peace.  
I can do my fair share in my community to help others.
That's how I can get my three wishes, not through a magic lamp.  
I can only get what I want through self-determination and hard work.  
That is the key to getting your wishes fulfilled.*

## 117 Help

>*Did you ever have to call for help? Were you ever in a situation that was an emergency? 
>It is good to know what to do in case of an emergency.  
You should always know how to get in touch with the police and fire departments.  
I have read stories where very young boys or girls have called the police and saved their friend's or family member's lives because they knew just who to get hold of.  
If you see a fire, you should call the fire department.  
A lot of tragedies have been prevented because the calls have been made quickly.  
It is important that emergency vehicles arrive very quickly.  
That is why those vehicles have sirens.
When their sirens go, it means to get out of the way.  
Policemen, firemen and ambulance attendants are trained to handle very difficult situations.  
They often save peoples' lives.  
They go through a lot of training to become good at what they do.  
They never panic in emergencies.  
For your part, you should keep emergency numbers near the phone, or know what the emergency numbers are.  
Where I live, there is a special number that you call for any emergency.  
We teach that number to everyone, even very tiny children.  
It is important to remain calm if you need help.  
If you call an emergency number, you have to be able to speak clearly, and tell the person you are talking to exactly what the problem is.  
I hope you are never in an emergency situation, but it is a good idea to be prepared.*

## 118 The Peach Orchard

>*When I was very young, I lived near a peach orchard.  
Now, there is a park where the orchard used to be.  
I always remember the peach orchard because my grandmother and I used to go there and pick peaches.  
The owner of the orchard would let all the neighbors pick peaches.  
It's not the fact that I used to get many ripe, tasty peaches that I remember; it's the time that I used to spend with my grandmother that I remember.  
My grandmother was very old, but she was very healthy.  
She used to walk a lot.  
I think that is what kept her fit.  
She had a lot of energy so she liked to go to a lot of places.  
She would get a fruit basket, and then she would ask me if I wanted to go to the orchard.  
I always said yes because I enjoyed walking through the orchard on a sunny day.  
We never climbed up on a ladder to reach the peaches; we just reached for the low hanging fruit.  
My grandmother and I used to talk all the time that we were out there.  
It was nice to spend time with her.  
She told me many stories about when she was a young girl.  
We laughed and got to know each other better.  
My grandmother only visited us during the summer.  
She lived in California, and I lived in Niagara Falls, so we didn't get to spend a lot of time with each other.  
We enjoyed the hot summer days in the orchard.  
You could smell the peaches, and the bees buzzed lazily by us.  
My grandmother would point out different insects and birds to me.  
I learned a lot about nature from her.  
We would end up with a big basket of peaches.  
When we got home, my mother would wash the peaches, and often she would bake a peach pie for us.  
Nobody bakes a peach pie like my mother.
It's good to have memories like that.  
Childhood memories of time spent with my grandmother are very precious to me.  
Sometimes, it's just the simple things that you do in life that leave you with the nicest memories.*

## 119 Learning to Dance

>*I went to England with my mother.  
She used to be a singer in a band.  
We went to the hotel that she used to sing at.  
It was a big fancy hotel.  
Some of the people that she knew when she sang in the band were still there.  
They remembered my mother, and they had a good time talking to her and remembering old times.  
Many people told me that I looked like my mother.  
In the hotel, they had a fancy hall where they had ballroom dancing.  
I am not used to that kind of dancing.  
I always dance to rock music.  
A man told me that he would teach me how to dance.  
It looked very easy.  
I held one of his hands, and put my other hand on his shoulder.  
He told me exactly how to move my feet.  
I was very clumsy, and I stepped on his toes.  
He was patient with me, and he counted "one, two, three." 
I tried to waltz with him.  
I would start out pretty well, but then I would get mixed up and stand on his toes again.  
The man laughed about it.  
I told him that I wasn't a very good dancer, but he said that I was good for a beginner.  
I think he was just being polite.  
The man asked my mother to dance.  
My mother is a very good dancer.  
I didn't know that about her.  
She never stepped on the man's toes once.  
The man thanked us for dancing with him, and I thanked him for giving me dancing lessons.  
I don't think I'll ever be very good at that type of dancing.  
Each generation has a specific type of dancing.  
The way that I dance is different from the way that my mother dances.  
The way that I dance doesn't involve moving your feet too much.  
I'm not too good at fancy steps.*

## 120 Super Heroes

>*When my brother was very young, he loved super heroes.  
He collected plastic figures of all the super heroes.  
I think he had every super hero figurine that there was.
He used to tie a towel over his shoulders and run through the back yard.  
He pretended that he was rescuing people.  
One time he stood on the roof.  
He really thought that he could fly with his super hero cape on.
He would have hurt himself if he had jumped.  
My dad saw him and told him to get down.  
My dad explained to my brother that super heroes are not real.  
Real people cannot fly from rooftops.  
My brother was disappointed.  
He thought that the super heroes really existed.  
My dad explained that most super heroes were created as comic book characters.  
Somebody used their imagination to make them up, and then an artist drew them.  
My brother was not impressed.  
He said that he wanted to meet the super heroes.  
My father told him that he might meet someone dressed up as a super hero, but it wouldn't really be a super hero in the costume.  
It is hard to explain to small children that the things that they see in comic books and on television aren't really real.  
My brother still pretends that he is a super hero.  
He doesn't jump from rooftops, but he runs around and makes noises like he is flying.  
I look at him and remember when I used to do things like that.  
I'm more mature than my brother.  
I know that super heroes aren't real, but I know that he is having fun and using his imagination.*
