## 211 - Being a Good Citizen

Every society has laws that regulate the way people behave. A good citizen should obey
laws. However, there is more to being a good citizen than merely obeying laws. There are
many other things that people can do to make their society a pleasant one for every
person.
One way to be a good citizen is to be polite in everyday activities. For example, when
passing through a door, a considerate person will hold the door open for a person who is
close behind. Holding doors open is especially important when someone is carrying a
heavy load.
Being a good citizen is very important when travelling on the roads and streets.
Pedestrians, bicyclists, and car drivers should all follow the rules of the road. Bicyclists
should yield to pedestrians, and car drivers should yield to both bicyclists and
pedestrians. Drivers should also allow other drivers to merge into their lanes. Also,
drivers should avoid honking their horns except when this is necessary.
A good citizen will also avoid doing things that interfere with others. For example, a
considerate person does not smoke cigarettes in areas where this might irritate others.
Also, a polite person avoids playing music so loudly that other people will be annoyed.
And of course, a good citizen avoids littering or making a mess.
Other ways of being a good citizen involve greater effort. Some people serve their
community by doing volunteer work of some kind. Other people help by donating money
to a charity. Another way to serve the community is to donate blood. Blood donors are
needed so that there will be enough blood available to help people who are sick or
injured.
Being a good citizen is very helpful for the community, and it also gives a feeling of
satisfaction and pride!

## 212 - Visiting the Doctor

When people feel sick, they go to a doctor. But sometimes people visit the doctor even
when they are not sick. Doctors can perform a medical "check-up", to find out if a person
is healthy. By performing this physical examination, the doctor can identify any health
problems that might be developing.
During a check-up, the doctor examines your eyes, ears, and throat. The doctor uses a
small flashlight to examine the eyes, ears, and throat. It is important to make sure that
the eyes react normally to changes in light. It is also important to make sure that the ears
and throat have a normal appearance. When the doctor examines your throat, he or she
will ask you open your mouth wide and say "ah".
The doctor uses a stethoscope to examine the patient's heartbeat. The stethoscope
hangs around the doctor's neck. By using a stethoscope, a doctor can hear the patient's
heartbeat very clearly. While checking the patient's heart, the doctor also listens carefully
to make sure that the patient's breathing is normal.
The doctor also checks the patient's blood pressure. Blood pressure is measured by
placing a cuff around the arm. Air is then pumped into the cuff, and this allows blood
pressure to be measured. Having very high blood pressure, or very low blood pressure,
is not good for one's health; it is better to be "in between".
Another part of the examination is a test of the reflexes. The doctor tests the patient's
reflexes by gently hitting his of her knee with a small hammer. If a person has normal
reflexes, the leg will extend suddenly.
Sometimes a doctor may give injections using a needle, as an extra part of the check-up.
These injections, called vaccinations, prevent the patient from developing certain
illnesses.
Medical check-ups can help to maintain health, but people should also maintain their
health by leading a healthy lifestyle.

## 213 - A Small Town

I grew up in a small town. There were only about two thousand people who lived in the
town where I grew up. When a town is very small, it is also called a village. My village
was surrounded by many farms and many lakes.
The house where my family lived was near the middle of the town. On the street where
we lived, most of the houses were similar in size, but many of them had different shapes
and different colors. Each house was surrounded by a yard, where people grew their
lawn and their garden.
Often, I would walk from my house to the downtown part of the village. "Downtown" is
the area where the stores and shops of a town are located. Because I lived in a small
town, it was a short walk to the downtown area. Along the main street, there were several
different kinds of stores. Some stores sold food, some stores sold clothing, and some
stores sold hardware (or building supplies).
It was also a short walk to the schools in my town. When I went to elementary school, it
would take about ten minutes to walk to the school. Some of my friends lived on the
same street where I lived. Sometimes, we walked to school together.
During the summer months, many people came from the big city to visit our village. The
people liked to get away from the busy streets of the city. They enjoyed the quietness
and the slow pace of village life. They also liked to spend their vacations near the lakes
that were near the village. People from the city often said that people who live in villages
seemed very friendly.
When I grew up, I left my village, and I went to work in a larger town. But sometimes I like
to go back and visit the place where I grew up.

## 214 - Personal Computers

During the 1980s and 1990s, personal computers became very widespread. The use of
the computer has changed people's lifestyles in several ways.
Before 1980, hardly anyone owned a computer. Only governments and large companies
had computers. But throughout the 1980s and 1990s, computers became much cheaper,
faster, and smaller, and they held much more memory. More and more people were able
to afford to buy a computer. By the year 2000, computers had become very common.
For many people, the personal computer is used mainly for performing calculations and
for word processing. For example, people can calculate their finances on the computer.
They can also use the computer to type their written documents, such as essays or
letters.
Many people enjoy playing games on their computers. Some people like to play chess or
checkers on their computer. Other people prefer games that require fast reflexes and fine
co-ordination. Computer games were very simple during the early days of the 1980s.
Today's computer games show detailed images and sounds.
Another very popular use of computers involves communication. Many people keep in
touch with their friends and relatives by using electronic mail, or e-mail. E-mail allows
people to send letters instantly to people far away. It is even possible to attach pictures
to one's e-mail messages.
Many people also like to use their computer to gain information on the Internet. The
Internet is a vast network of electronic pages where people can find information on many
different topics. For example, people can read newspapers and magazines on the
Internet.
Personal computers have only existed for a short time. But for many people, those
computers have quickly become a very useful part of everyday life!

## 215 - Methods of Transportation

In the modern age, people often travel long distances. Sometimes people travel for
reasons related to their work. Sometimes they travel as tourists. And sometimes people
travel to visit relatives and friends.
There are many different ways that people can travel. Some forms of transportation move
people along the ground. Other methods of transportation move people across the water,
or through the air.
Airplanes provide the fastest method of travelling. Modern jet airliners travel at about
1000 kilometres per hour. These airplanes cruise through the skies, almost ten
kilometres above the level of the sea. Jet airplanes allow people to travel great distances
in a short time. For example, it is possible to fly across a great ocean, such as the Pacific
or the Atlantic, in several hours.
Ships were once the only way to travel across the oceans. Before airplanes, it took many
weeks or months to travel around the world. Today, many people still travel by ship when
crossing smaller bodies of water. Some ships, called ferries, allow people to bring their
cars with them onto the ship. Some people also like to travel by ship as part of a holiday.
These holiday ships, called cruise ships, stop in several interesting ports along the
voyage.
Trains are very popular in many places. In some places, such as Japan and France, trains
travel at high speeds of about 300 kilometres per hour. These trains move people
throughout the country very quickly and efficiently. Trains are also used to move people
over short distances, such as the trip from one's home to one's workplace.
Buses and cars are also widely used for transportation. Some people travel by bus or car
for only short trips, but sometimes buses and cars are used for very long journeys. In
North America, many people have driven across Canada or the United States in their cars.
The wide, smooth roads allow cars and buses to travel quickly from one place to another.
There are many different methods of transportation. Which one do you think is the best?

## 216 - A Life Experience

My friend Lani and I went to Burger King yesterday. We ordered a big order of french
fries and a couple of drinks. Lani got a strawberry milkshake.
I picked out a table near the window so we could look at the people passing by. As we
were sitting there, we heard our favourite song, "Butterfly" by the band Crazy Town come
on the radio. We looked at each other with big grins on our faces and started singing and
dancing!
It was great fun. Many people began staring at us, wondering why we were so happy. We
didn't care; we just kept on moving and enjoying ourselves.
The song ended, and we were almost finished our food. We sat and talked about what
was happening in our lives. She had just bought four new t-shirts for the summer. The
new sandals she had gotten for her birthday had given her really bad blisters on the
sides of her feet. When she wore other shoes, she had to wear bandaids on the blisters. I
told her that I had bought four new C.D.'s. I love music!
As we finished our conversation, we finished off our drinks. I like going out with Lani and
talking. Lani is my best friend and I can talk to her about anything. I am glad I have her to
share my life with, even if it is as simple as going to Burger King and eating french fries!
Lani and I are planning to travel together so we are trying to save our money. Our french
fries and drink only came to about $6, so we didn't feel too bad about spending our
money!
I wonder though, if McDonald's would have been cheaper?

## 217 - Air Plane Ride

Tasha signed a piece of paper which gave her a chance to win a free air plane ride. She
put her name, address and telephone number on that piece of paper. A few days later she
got a telephone call. It was the man that was holding the ticket draw. Tasha didn't think
she would win, but the man on the telephone said she did!
She listened as the man told her where she would have to go to get her free air plane ride.
She had to go near the town of Grimsby. She was allowed to pick a friend to go with her
on the air plane ride. Tasha was so happy! She asked her twin sister Tawnya to go with
her. Tawnya was very excited! Neither of them had been on an air plane before.
When they got to the air plane centre, Tasha and Tawnya were nervous. They knew the
air plane was small so that meant only the pilot and them were going to be in the plane.
Their mom took a picture of them beside the plane before they left.
Tasha and Tawnya hopped into the plane. They put their seatbelts on and got ready for
take-off. Tasha got to sit in the very front, right beside the pilot. Tawnya sat behind Tasha.
The girls laughed nervously as the plane started rolling down the runway. They went
faster and faster, trees passing by quickly. There was a powerful surge making
everyone's head jerk back. The plane started lifting off the ground. Up, up, and away!
They were up off the ground and flying high in the sky! It seemed as though they could
get anywhere within a matter of seconds. They flew from Grimsby to Beamsville where
they saw their high school. Then, on to St. Catharines and then Niagara Falls. They even
flew over top of their house! They took pictures of their house. They could see their pond
from way up there, too.
The pilot asked Tasha if she wanted to fly the plane. "Sure!" Tasha said. So, Tasha took
the steering handle and began to fly the plane. She didn't really know how to fly it, so
when she pulled the handle down, the plane shot upward. Both of the girls squealed.
Tasha levelled the plane and flew smoothly from then on.
Soon it was time to go back to Grimsby. The pilot took over again. We braced ourselves
as the landing strip got nearer. The landing went smoothly with Tasha and Tawnya
beaming as they looked out at the ground. They hopped off of the plane, thanked the
pilot and ran to tell their mom about their wonderful experience.

## 218 - A Rainy Day

The clouds were very gray. There was a loud boom that came from the sky. A bolt of
lightning struck down a tree. All of a sudden buckets of rain came pouring down!
Jane and Bill were walking in a park when the rain started. Jane wanted to take pictures
of the flowers, but the rain got her camera wet. She had to put it away so that it wouldn't
get ruined.
Jane was going to hide under a big tree to stay dry, but Bill told her that was not a safe
idea. He said that she could get hurt if the lightning hit the tree. The tree could break and
fall on her, or the lightning could even hit her!
The air was very chilly. Jane and Bill put on their sweaters and raincoats to keep warm.
Jane took her umbrella out and put it up. They both walked under it to stay dry.
The ground was really wet and muddy. Bill and Jane were very glad that they
remembered to wear their boots. They ran through the puddles, getting mud and water all
over the back of their pants.
As they were running and having fun, they saw some ducks. There were five of them
splashing around in a pond. The ducks were not afraid of water; they swim in the water
all the time!
Jane and Bill saw some big bull frogs near the pond. The frogs jumped into the pond
when they heard Jane and Bill coming.
After a little while Jane and Bill decided to go home. They got into some dry clothes.
Jane started to sneeze. She had gotten a little bit too wet!
Bill noticed that the rain had stopped. "Look outside Jane," he said. Jane wrapped a
blanket around her shoulders and looked outside. There was a beautiful, bright rainbow
across the sky Violet, blue, green, yellow, orange and red, the rainbow shone high in the
sky. "I wonder if there's a pot of gold on the other side?" Jane asked. She had once been
told that Leprechauns lived on the other side handing out money to those that made it to
the rainbow's end.
Bill didn't believe there was a pot of gold. Jane ignored Bill though and started off across
the field, to claim her big pot of money.
Let's hope Jane finds her way back home, safe and sound, with a big pot of gold!

## 219 - Elementary School

I go to Gainsborough Public Elementary School. I am in Grade 8. I am known as the
"King/Queen" of the school this year. I feel very grown up. I love being the oldest kid in
the school. My friends and I are told that we are examples to the younger kids in the
school. That means we need to be good. I remember looking up to the grade eight kids
when I was younger. I remember thinking how big and wise they seemed to be. Now that
I'm in grade eight, I hope that the younger kids see me as wise.
I want to be a music teacher or maybe a nurse. My school counsellor helps me plan for
high school. I am nervous because I know I will not feel like the "King" anymore. Things
will be so different. I am excited because I will be meeting so many new people!
I am looking forward to my graduation. I will wear a pink, silky dress. My shoes are a light
pink, too. My date's name is Chad. He is very nice. He is a good friend. I have known
Chad since I was a little girl.
I know that my future will be a bright one. I will miss all of my friends but I know we will
see each other again someday.

## 220 - The Middle Child

I am the middle child of the family.
I think it is nice in some ways.
I have an older sister from whom I can borrow clothes from, if she lets me.
I get to meet my older sister's friends, although sometimes they think that I am too young
to be with them.
I have a younger brother.
He is cute, but sometimes I have to baby-sit him.
There are good things and bad things about being the middle child.
My sister is the eldest child.
She was the first child, so she spent time alone with my parents.
She got lots of attention when she was first born.
They took lots and lots of pictures of her.
All her clothes and toys were brand new.
I got her hand-me-downs.
My parents were the strictest with her.
They had lots of rules for her to follow.
She is the first child, so they want her to be perfect.
My younger brother is the baby of the family.
I think that we all spoil him.
We let him get away with some things that he shouldn't get away with.
His room is always messy, and my mother never gets mad about that.
She gets upset with me if my room is messy.
She tells me that I'm old enough to keep a nice clean room.
It's no good thinking about which position you would like to hold in the family.
You really don't have a choice about that.
I think I like being the middle child.
I can relate to my older sister and my younger brother.
Yes, I think the middle is probably a good place to be.

## 221 - Advice to a Student from a Foreign Country

My advice to a student from a foreign country would be to talk, talk, talk.
Talk as much as you can to the people who live in the place that you are visiting.
Talk to them and practice your new language skills.
Learn all the funny sayings and different words that make up their language.
Talking is the only way to really learn a language.
Listen to people and talk to people.
If you talk to people, you will also learn about their culture.
I have a friend from Japan.
His name is Nori.
He often comes to see me just so that he can practice his English.
He gets confused about words that sound the same, but mean different things.
He was asking me about the words "see" and "sea."
I explained to him that they do sound the same, but they are spelled differently, and they
mean different things.
Nori is learning some of our funny sayings from different people.
One morning I asked him how he was, and he said "alive and kicking."
Another morning when I asked him how he was, he said "so so."
He laughs about these strange sayings that we use.
He is learning English quickly because he spends a lot of time with English-speaking
people.
He likes to have lunch with my friends and me because we ask him questions about his
homeland, and he answers us in English.
If he doesn't understand our questions, we spend time explaining what we mean to him.
He says that he enjoys being here.
He thinks that the people are very friendly.
We enjoy speaking to him and helping him to learn English.
We also enjoy learning about his country.
It is enjoyable for us to meet new people and learn about new things.

## 222 - A Ghost

One dark and gloomy night, I was sitting in my bedroom reading ghost stories.
The stories were very scary.
A storm was brewing outside my window.
The wind began to howl, and the trees shook and bent in the wind.
Lightening started to flash across the sky.
I felt uneasy as I heard the low rumble of thunder.
I glanced around my room.
The shadows were deep and dark.
The ghost stories were making my imagination play tricks on me.
I thought that the shadows were moving.
I looked under my bed to make sure that nothing was under there.
I hid under the covers and peeked out.
I was starting to hear things.
A big streak of lightening flashed across the sky, and a loud clap of thunder made me
jump.
I was very nervous.
All of a sudden, I heard a noise.
It was coming from my closet.
I thought that it must be a ghost.
I looked out from under my covers and waited for the ghost to appear.
My face was white, and I was very, very scared.
Then, I heard the noise again.
Yes, there was definitely a rustling in my closet.
I stayed very still and did not make a sound.
I watched the closet and hoped that the ghost would not come flying out at me.
Something started to come out of the closet.
I squeezed my eyes shut.
I didn't dare to look at the ghost.
I heard it come out of the closet.
I felt it jump up on my bed.
I was still too scared to look.
Then the ghost made a noise.
It said, "meow."
I opened my eyes and saw my kitten standing there.
It was my kitten that had made the rustling noises in the closet.
I laughed and felt very foolish.
I have decided not to read ghost stories on dark stormy nights.
I think my imagination plays tricks on me when I read ghost stories on nights like that.

## 223 - Louis Pasteur

Louis Pasteur was one of the greatest scientists of all time. Pasteur made very important discoveries
in biology and chemistry, and the techniques he developed helped greatly to develop medical
science and the agricultural and food industries.
Pasteur was born in a small town in France during the year 1822. When he was a young
man, Pasteur studied science at a university in the city of Paris. He soon did some
excellent work in chemistry, and later began his famous study of germs.
Pasteur was one of the first scientists to understand that many diseases could be caused
by extremely small, invisible organisms. Only a few other scientists had believed this
before Pasteur. He advised doctors to wash their hands thoroughly before treating
patients.
Pasteur also demonstrated that life forms did not arise spontaneously. His research
confirmed the idea, developed by previous scientists, that a living organism would not
appear unless other individuals of its kind were present.
One of Pasteur's most important contributions was a technique that has been named
after him: pasteurization. Pasteurization kills the germs that are found in drinks such as
milk or beer. Because of Pasteur's technique, people are no longer infected with
diseases by drinking these liquids.
Just as important as pasteurization was a technique called immunization. Pasteur found
that a person or animal could be made safe, or immune, from a disease, by injecting the
person with some weakened germs that cause the disease. The body can resist the
disease after being immunized in this way. Today, many diseases are prevented by the
use of this technique.
Pasteur's discoveries also helped to save people who had already been infected with
diseases. One such disease is rabies. Rabies is a disease that sometimes occurs in
animals. This disease usually kills the animal, but before dying, the animal becomes very
aggressive, and may spread the disease by biting a person or another animal.
One day, the parents of a young boy came to Pasteur. Their son had been bitten by a dog
that had the rabies disease. The parents knew that their son would die from the disease,
unless something could be done to save him. Pasteur agreed to help the boy, and the
immunization technique saved the boy's life.
Pasteur died in 1895. He was greatly admired around the world for his achievements,
which have helped all of humankind. Today, Pasteur is considered to be the greatest
figure in the history of medicine.

## 224 - Psychology

Are you interested in the behaviour of people and animals? If you are, then you might
enjoy the study of psychology. Psychology is the study of behaviour, but this is a very
large area of study. There are several different branches of psychology, each of which
studies a different aspect of behaviour.
Social psychologists study interactions among people. For example, a social
psychologist might try to learn about the situations that cause people to behave
aggressively. Another question studied by social psychologists is why certain people
become attracted to each other. One of the interesting problems in social psychology is
conformity: what causes people to behave in the same way, and to follow what others do
and say?
Cognitive psychologists study thinking, memory, and language. One problem studied by
cognitive psychologists is how people remember numbers. For example, what is the best
way to memorize some numbers? Is it better to repeat the numbers to oneself, or to try to
attach some meaning to these numbers? A cognitive psychologist might also study
language. For example, why can young children learn a second language so quickly and
easily? Cognitive psychologists are also interested in the ways that people learn to solve
problems, such as finding a new place.
Clinical psychologists study mental illnesses. For example, a clinical psychologist might
try to find out the causes of depression and to figure out ways of helping people who are
depressed. Other clinical psychologists might study the behaviour of people who suffer
from addiction to drugs, so that this problem can be prevented and treated. Another topic
of interest to clinical psychologists is violent behaviour. It is very important to find ways
of preventing violence and to change the behaviour of persons who act violently.
Some psychologists are interested in the measurement of psychological characteristics.
For example, psychologists might develop tests to assess a person's intelligence,
personality traits, or interests. These tests can be used to help people make decisions
about education, occupation, and clinical treatment.
Psychologists who study the behaviour of animals are called ethologists. Ethologists
often go into wilderness areas to watch the activity of birds, fish, or other animals. These
psychologists try to figure out why it is that some animals have "instincts" for various
behaviours such as parenting, mating, or fighting. Some ethologists have learned very
much about the unusual behaviours observed in many animals.
These are only a few of the many areas of psychology. Truly, psychology is one of the
most interesting areas of knowledge!

## 225 - Corruption

When an official of a government or business is acting dishonestly, we say that this
person is corrupt. Corruption is a serious problem in many countries around the world.
There are several different kinds of corrupt practices, including bribes, kickbacks,
nepotism, and embezzlement.
A bribe is a payment of money or some other benefit, in exchange for a decision that
would not otherwise be made. For example, an accused criminal might bribe a judge so
that the judge would make a decision of "not guilty." Another example is that a business
owner might bribe a government official so that the official would allow the construction
of very unsafe buildings.
A kickback is similar to a bribe, except that the official receives some part of the money
in a dishonest business deal. For example, governments sometimes decide which
company should build a road. A company might offer money to the government official
who makes the decision, so that this company will be chosen, even if it is not the best
company for the job.
Nepotism happens when an official unfairly gives advantages to his or her relatives. For
example, a government official might hire a brother or sister to do a job even though
other people would be much better qualified for the job. Of course, all of us want to help
our relatives, but it is wrong to do this at the expense of the public.
Embezzlement happens when an official secretly steals some money from a company or
government. For example, a manager at a company might secretly move some of the
company's money to his or her own bank account, or that manager might lie about his or
her expenses in order to receive more payment from the company.
Corruption has very bad effects on people, in several ways. Sometimes it can lead to
very dangerous situations. One example of this is when unsafe construction projects are
approved by officials who have been bribed. Another example is when criminals are
freed as a result of bribes. Also, a country's economy can be damaged by corruption. For
example, if companies must pay bribes in order to do business, then they may decide to
leave the country. Also, if people's tax money is stolen by corrupt officials, this makes
the people poorer. In addition, when company officials are corrupt, it makes the company
less able to compete with other companies.
How can corruption be stopped? An important step is for each person to decide not to
act in ways that are corrupt. People must agree to take this problem seriously. Also, each
company and each government must have strict rules about corruption. It must be very
clear to all employees-from the lowest to the highest-that corruption is totally
unacceptable.

## 226 - Canada : Provinces and Territories

Canada is one of the largest countries in the world. It is located in the northern half of the
continent of North America, above the United States. Canada is divided into ten
provinces and three territories, each of which is different from the others.
The province of British Columbia is located at the far western end of Canada. British
Columbia stretches from the Pacific Ocean, at the west, to the Rocky Mountains, at the
east. British Columbia contains the city of Vancouver, where two million people live. Most
of the land of British Columbia is very mountainous, with vast forests covering the
mountains. In British Columbia, forestry is an important industry, providing wood for
people around the world.
Moving east from British Columbia, the next provinces are Alberta, Saskatchewan, and
Manitoba. These are known as the prairie provinces, because they are mostly made of
flat, grassy land called "prairie." Alberta is the province where the flat prairie meets the
tall and beautiful Rocky Mountains. In Alberta, there are many fields where oil and gas
are found, and there are also many farms where cattle are raised. Saskatchewan is the
Canadian province that grows the most wheat. Wheat from Saskatchewan is sent around
the world to make bread and pasta for many people. Manitoba is the other prairie
province. Its largest city, Winnipeg, is about halfway between the Pacific and Atlantic
oceans. Winnipeg has the coldest winters of any large city in the world, with
temperatures sometimes reaching -40 degrees Celsius!
Moving east, the next province is Ontario. The land in the northern part of Ontario is very
rocky and contains many thousands and thousands of lakes. Many mines are found in
northern Ontario. In the southern part of Ontario, there is good farmland, and there are
also many cities where factories produce cars and steel. Ontario contains Canada's
largest city, Toronto, as well as the capital city of Canada--Ottawa. In the southern part of
Ontario are four of the largest lakes in the world, known as the Great Lakes.
Next to Ontario is the province of Quebec. Unlike the other provinces, where most people
speak English, most of the people in Quebec speak French. The capital of Quebec is
called Quebec City, and this is one of the oldest cities in North America. Quebec City
contains many buildings that are hundreds of years old. Also in the province of Quebec
is the city of Montreal. Of all the French-speaking cities in the world, only Paris is larger
than Montreal!
In the eastern part of Canada are the Atlantic provinces, which are next to the Atlantic
Ocean. These provinces are New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and
Newfoundland. In the Atlantic provinces, fishing is an important industry. Tourism is also
important as many people come to see the beauty of these provinces. The people in
these provinces are said to be the friendliest in Canada.
In the far north of Canada are the three territories that lie beside the Arctic Ocean: Yukon,
Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. Many of the people in these territories are the Native
people of Canada, known as the Indians and the Inuit. The northern areas have very cold,
dark winters. The summer is short, but the days are very long and bright.

## 227 - Two Great Artists : Leonardo and Michelangelo

Many people admire the paintings and sculptures that artists create. Some very beautiful
paintings and sculptures were created by two men who lived in the same country at the
same time. These men were Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. They both lived in Italy
around the year 1500.
Leonardo da Vinci is most famous for his painting called the Mona Lisa. This is perhaps
the best-known painting in the world. The Mona Lisa shows the head and shoulders of a
dark-haired woman. When people look at this painting, they are often captivated by her
smile and by her eyes, which have a look of mystery.
Another painting of Leonardo's is called The Last Supper. This painting shows a famous
scene from the Christian religion. In this painting, Jesus Christ is seated at the middle of
a long table, with his followers (the disciples) seated around him. Many of the paintings
that were created at this time have a religious theme.
Leonardo was not only an artist; he was also interested in engineering. He actually
worked for some time as an advisor to a military leader, helping him to develop new
machines for use in war. Leonardo also made rough drawings of machines that are
similar to those that were invented much later, such as submarines and helicopters.
Obviously, Leonardo was an extremely creative man.
Michelangelo was about 23 years younger than Leonardo. In addition to being a painter,
Michelangelo was also a sculptor, and many experts consider him the greatest sculptor
of all time. One of his most famous sculptures is David, which is a statue of a young man
who was a famous figure in the Bible. Another great sculpture of Michelangelo's is called
the Pieta. The Pieta shows Mary, the mother of Jesus, holding the body of her son across
her lap.
Michelangelo is also famous for painting the ceiling of a church known as the Sistine
Chapel. The leader of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Julius, asked Michelangelo to
paint the ceiling of this new church. This project required many years of hard work, and
the Pope complained that it took too long. However, when the work was finished, the
ceiling of the Sistine Chapel was covered with beautiful paintings of many scenes from
the Bible.
Fortunately, many of the works of Leonardo and of Michelangelo can still be seen today
in the art galleries of Europe. During the past 500 years, the color of the paintings had
faded somewhat, but in recent years, some work has been done to restore the paintings
to their original appearance.

## 228 - The Viking

About a thousand years ago, people known as the Vikings were known and feared
throughout Europe. The Vikings were the people of the northern part of Europe, called
Scandinavia, which includes the modern countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
The Vikings made their living by farming and fishing. However, by about the year 700,
they began making attacks, or raids, upon towns along the coasts of Europe in order to
steal the wealth of those towns.
The Vikings made their attacks very quickly and without any warning. They were very
cruel to the people of the towns they attacked, and they sometimes destroyed the towns
by burning down the buildings. In some parts of Europe, the local kings would often fight
against the Vikings. Sometimes, however, the kings would pay the Vikings in order to
persuade them not to attack.
Although the Vikings were known as fierce warriors, they also built excellent ships. The
wooden Viking ships, called longboats, were able to sail even in very bad weather. Many
Viking longboats were about 20 metres long, but some were nearly 90 metres long. The
Viking sailors used both sails and oars to move their ships.
The Vikings travelled across a large area. They made many of their attacks in Britain,
France, and Germany, but sometimes sailed south, into the Mediterranean Sea. Other
Vikings moved to the east, and then south along the rivers of Russia. Some even went as
far as the area that is now the country of Turkey. In some places, the Vikings decided to
stay. Many Vikings settled in England and in France, and eventually they mixed with the
local people. Other Vikings settled in Russia and also mixed with the people there.
The most famous travels of the Vikings were in the Atlantic Ocean. Vikings sailed
westward to the island of Iceland where many of them stayed. Today, the people of
Iceland are descended from the Vikings. Some Vikings sailed farther west to the cold
island of Greenland. Vikings lived in Greenland for several generations, but eventually
they died out. Some Vikings had gone even further west and reached the Canadian island
of Newfoundland. The Vikings only stayed for a few years, but they had reached North
America about 500 years before Christopher Columbus!
Gradually, the Vikings became converted to the Christian religion. They also stopped
raiding the towns of Europe, and instead of fighting, they began trading with their
neighbors. Today, the Scandinavian countries are known as very peace-loving nations.

## 229 - William Shakespeare

There have been many great writers in the history of English literature, but there is no
doubt about which writer was the greatest. Many people consider William Shakespeare to
have been the best writer who ever lived.
William Shakespeare was born in the town of Stratford, England, in the year 1564. When
he was a young man, Shakespeare moved to the city of London, where he began writing
plays. His plays were soon very successful, and were enjoyed both by the common
people of London and also by the rich and famous. In addition to his plays, Shakespeare
wrote many short poems and a few longer poems. Like his plays, these poems are still
famous today.
Shakespeare's most famous plays include Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Hamlet, King Lear,
Othello, and Julius Caesar. Usually, Shakespeare did not invent the stories that he told in
his plays. Instead, he wrote his plays using stories that already existed. However,
Shakespeare's plays told these stories in a more interesting way than ever before. Some
of the stories were tragedies, some were comedies, and some described historical
events.
In his plays, Shakespeare revealed a very wide knowledge of many areas of life. The
characters in his plays discuss many different topics, often with the knowledge of
experts. But what is even more impressive about these plays is Shakespeare's use of the
English language. His vocabulary was very large, and Shakespeare seems to have
introduced many words to the language! Also, many of the phrases that are said by
Shakespeare's characters are now used in everyday conversation. Today, writers often
use quotations from Shakespeare's plays in their own works.
But perhaps even the most impressive features of Shakespeare's plays are the
characters within them. The many characters in his plays seem very different from each
other, but they seem very realistic. The emotions they feel, the words they say, and the
actions they perform are all easily understood. Many people who watch one of
Shakespeare's plays will find that they know people who remind them somewhat of the
characters in those plays.
Shakespeare died in the year 1619, but his writings are still popular today, 400 years after
they were written. The poems and plays are greatly admired by experts in literature, but
also by people in general. Each year, hundreds of thousands of people enjoy attending
performances of Shakespeare's plays. No other writer in the English language has
remained so popular for such a long time.

## 230 - Ice Hockey

One of the most popular sports in northern countries is the game of ice hockey. Each
winter, this sport is played by hundreds of thousands of children and adults in North
America and in Europe. Ice hockey is a fast and exciting game that can make winter
much more enjoyable.
The game of ice hockey is played on a flat surface of ice called a rink. The rink is about
60 metres long, and about 25 or 30 metres wide. At any time, each team has six players
on the ice. On their feet the players wear skates, whose thin metal blades allow fast
movement along the ice surface. Learning to skate requires time and practice, but many
people can skate very quickly and smoothly.
In many ways, ice hockey is similar to soccer. However, unlike soccer, there is no large
ball used in hockey. Instead, the players use a hard, black, rubber disk, which is called a
puck. The players skate around the ice, trying to get the puck. They do not use their
hands or their feet to control the puck. Instead, they carry long wooden sticks, which are
shaped in such a way that it is easy to push the puck along the ice. The players can pass
the puck to each other by sliding it across the ice.
To score a goal, a hockey player must shoot the puck into the net of the opposing team,
but this is a difficult task. The net is less than two metres wide, and it is protected by a
player called the goaltender. However, some players can shoot the puck very suddenly
and with great power.
Sometimes, the sport of ice hockey can be quite rough. Players try to take the puck from
their opponents by bumping into them at a high speed. This is called a "body check."
Players are not allowed to hit each other with their sticks. If a player does this, then that
player may be given a penalty by the referee, who enforces the rules of the game.
Naturally, the sport of ice hockey is most popular in countries that have cold winters. The
sport was first played in Canada, but it is also very popular in many countries of Europe,
including Russia, Sweden, Finland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Germany. In
addition, many people play hockey in the United States.
In previous generations, ice hockey was considered a sport for men and boys only.
However, in recent years, women and girls have been playing hockey much more
frequently than in the past. Not only do many girls enjoy playing hockey for fun, but now
women's hockey is officially a sport at the winter Olympics.

## 231 - Chinese People in North America

In recent years, many people have moved to North America from China, but many people
do not know that Chinese people have a long history in Canada and the United States.
During the nineteenth century, both Canada and the United States were rapidly
expanding to the west, toward the Pacific Ocean. In those days, there were of course no
cars or airplanes to allow people and goods to move across the land. Instead, the best
method of long-distance transportation was the railroad. Railway trains could move
quickly across the countryside. However, there was one problem: before the railway
trains could run, railroads had to be built across very long distances.
To build the railroads was a very big job. Many men would be needed because the
distance was so long and the land was so difficult, with many mountains and rivers to be
crossed. For the men who owned the railroad companies, it would have been too
expensive to hire Canadian or American men to build the railroads because those
workers would only work for high wages.
The railroad owners decided to get workers from overseas. Many Chinese men were
willing to work for low wages because they were very poor. These men would work very
hard and send much of the money back to their relatives in China.
Thousands of Chinese men were brought to North America to work on the railroads. They
did good work, but their employers treated them badly. The work day was very long, and
working conditions were very unsafe. Many Chinese men died in accidents while
constructing the railroads. Some Chinese women also came to North America, but there
were many more men than women.
After the railroads were completed, by about the year 1900, very few Chinese people
were allowed to come to North America. Most people in Canada and the United States
were not familiar with Chinese people and did not want strangers to come to their
countries. Any Chinese person who came to North America had to pay an expensive tax.
This made it difficult for Chinese men to bring their wives and families to join them in
North America. Later, the governments of Canada and the United States made Chinese
immigration illegal.
Eventually, the people of Canada and the United States realized that their laws had been
unfair. They changed the rules so that Chinese people could immigrate in the same way
that people from other countries could do so. In recent decades, many Chinese people
have moved to North America, and have formed a very lively and successful community.
Many cities, such as Toronto, Vancouver, San Francisco, and New York, have been
enriched by Chinese culture. Chinese people are now very prominent in North America,
just as they were many years ago.

## 232 - The History of the English Language

Most people know that the English language is spoken by many millions of people
around the world. However, few people are aware of the history of the English language.
Today, English is one language, but in some ways it is a mixture of many different
languages.
The English language is most closely related to a group of languages called the
Germanic languages. This group also includes languages such as German and Dutch.
About 1500 years ago, these languages were not yet distinct from each other. Some of
the people of Germany and the Netherlands then moved to England. Those people were
called the Anglo-Saxons, and their language then evolved into English. Most of the basic
words of the English language are derived from these very old Anglo-Saxon languages.
For example, the words for the parts of the body, for numbers, and for animals are mostly
Anglo-Saxon words.
Some new words were brought to England over 1000 years ago by people who came
from the Scandinavian countries of northern Europe. Many words that begin with the
letters "sk", such as skin and skill, are Scandinavian words.
A major change happened in the English language after the year 1066. In that year,
England was conquered by a king from the northern part of France. He and his followers
spoke French, so French became an important language in England. During the next few
hundred years, the English language absorbed a very large number of French words. In
fact, today's English dictionaries contain more words of French origin than of Anglo-
Saxon origin. Part of the reason why the English language has so many words is that it
often has two words for each idea-one word of Anglo-Saxon origin, and one word of
French origin.
Many more words entered the English language a few hundred years ago, when science
and technology became more widespread. Most scientific and technical words are
derived from words of the ancient languages of Latin and Greek. Because there are so
many of these scientific and technical words in the English language today, the influence
of Latin and Greek has been quite large.
Other languages have also contributed many words to the English language. Some
words have come from the Celtic languages, spoken in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.
Many words have been added to the English language by immigrants who came to North
America from various countries of Europe. Also, many more words have been adopted
from the Native languages of North America, Australia, and the Pacific, and from the
languages of peoples in Africa and Asia. All of these words have made English a very
interesting language!

## 233 - African Slavery in the Americas

One of the most tragic parts of the history of North and South America is the period of
African slavery. For hundreds of years, many people were taken from Africa, by force, to
work in the fields of many different countries in North and South America.
When Europeans first came to the Americas, some of them realized that they might make
money by growing crops and selling them in Europe. However, in order to make money,
they would need a cheap source of labor. Few Europeans would come to the Americas to
work for low wages, so instead, the landowners looked for slaves. In the areas of the
great farms, or plantations, there were few Indians, so they used another source of
slaves: Africa.
The plantation owners usually obtained slaves by buying them from local kings in
western Africa. This led to many wars between rival kings within Africa, who tried to
capture each other's people in order to sell them as slaves. A few kings tried to avoid the
slave trade, but this was very difficult.
During a period of several hundred years, from the 1500s to the 1800s, about 12 million
people were taken from western Africa to the Americas. Many more people died as slaves
before leaving Africa, and many more died on the ships that took them to the Americas.
This was because the conditions on the ships were extremely unhealthy: the ships were
far too crowded, and there was little food and water.
When the African slaves arrived in the Americas, the plantation owners made them work
on farms that produced goods such as cotton and sugar. In many places, the work was
very hard, and many of the slaves died from overwork. They were then replaced by other
slaves who arrived from Africa. However, many slaves survived despite the brutal
conditions. In some places, the African slaves were able to revolt against the plantation
owners. However, this was difficult because the slaves who had recently arrived spoke
many different languages. Some slaves escaped into wilderness areas and were able to
remain free from the plantation owners.
As time went by, many people in Europe and in the Americas realized that slavery was
wrong. By the 1830s, slavery had been ended, or abolished, in islands owned by the
British, and in parts of the United States. In the southern United States, slavery was
ended in the 1860s, during the Civil War. In some countries, such as Brazil and Cuba,
slavery only ended in the 1880s.
Today, many millions of people in North and South America are the descendants of
slaves who were brought from Africa. The effects of slavery have lasted for many
generations, and there was much racial prejudice against African people even when
slavery ended. However, some have achieved success despite these disadvantages.
Today, the people of African background in North and South America are a very
important part of the population in many countries.

## 234 - Worries About Physical Appearance

Most people would like to have an attractive physical appearance, but some people
become very worried about the way they look. This can sometimes lead them to do
things that are unhealthy.
For example, many women believe that they must be very thin in order to be attractive.
They see pictures of fashion models who are very thin and then believe that an attractive
woman must look the same way. However, many men prefer the appearance of women
who are not so thin.
In order to become thin, some women try to reduce the amount of food that they eat.
When this is taken to an extreme, a woman might eat far too little food to remain healthy.
Her weight may become dangerously low, as she tries to become thinner and thinner.
This condition is called "anorexia," and it affects many thousands of women in Western
countries.
Anorexia is one of several conditions known as eating disorders. Another eating disorder
is called "bulimia." A woman who has bulimia will sometimes eat large amounts of food,
but then will try to eliminate the food, by vomiting. This is intended to prevent any weight
gain, but it is also a very unhealthy behavior.
Unfortunately, some women are concerned about being very thin, but some women have
different concerns related to the appearance of their body. For example, some women
believe that their breasts are not large enough, and undergo surgery to enlarge their
breasts. In this surgery, some artificial substance is implanted inside the breast to make
it larger. Many women have had this surgery, but many of them have suffered serious
health problems as a result.
In recent years, many men have also become very concerned about their physical
appearance. For example, some men believe that they must become very muscular in
order to have an attractive appearance. To achieve this appearance, some men use drugs
called steroids, which make it possible to gain large amounts of muscle. However,
steroids can have very unhealthy side effects. In addition to drugs, some men have used
surgery to change their physical appearance. For example, some men have had implants
to make their arms, legs, or chest appear larger.
It is unfortunate that so many people feel so unhappy about their physical appearance
and that they do unhealthy things to change the way they look. Of course, everyone
should try to be healthy, but people must also learn to accept their physical appearance.
Many different body types can be attractive, and there is no single ideal body type. There
is no need to use unnatural methods of changing one's body.

## 235 - Physical Fitness

In modern society, many people find that they do not get very much exercise. They travel
by bus, train, or car, and they can move up or down in elevators. They have machines
that do most of the heavy work that was once done by people. However, exercise is
important for staying healthy. A person who exercises frequently will be "physically fit."
There are different aspects of physical fitness.
One important element of being physically fit is called cardio-vascular fitness. The word
"cardio-vascular" refers to the heart and lungs. If one's heart and lungs are in good
condition, then one can exercise at a steady pace without soon getting tired. To develop
cardio-vascular fitness, it is important to perform some exercise that makes one's heart
beat quickly. For example, a person can improve cardio-vascular fitness by riding a
bicycle, by running, by swimming, by rowing, or even by walking quickly. Some people
go to special places, called "health clubs" or "gyms," where they can use different
exercise machines to develop their cardio-vascular fitness. But many people improve
their cardio-vascular fitness by playing recreational sports, such as tennis or soccer, or
by dancing vigorously. By having good cardio-vascular fitness, one is less likely to suffer
from heart disease. Of course, there is one way to improve cardio-vascular fitness that
does not involve exercise: stop smoking!
Another important aspect of physical fitness is called flexibility. Flexibility refers to one's
ability to stretch comfortably. For example, a healthy person should be able to touch his
or her toes without bending the legs. People can perform various stretching exercises to
improve flexibility. By being flexible, a person can avoid injuries that might otherwise
affect their body.
Yet another important aspect of physical fitness is the strength and endurance of one's
muscles. Many people suffer from injuries that result, in part, from weakness of the
muscles. Muscular strength and endurance can be improved by a variety of exercises.
Some of these exercises involve lifting a weight, but other exercises simply involve
pushing or pulling against the weight of one's own body. One example is an exercise
called the "push-up." In this exercise, a person lies on the floor, with the face pointing
down. The person bends his or her arms, so that the palms of the hands are on the floor,
next to the shoulders. The person then pushes with his or her arms, lifting the upper part
of the body above the ground until the arms are straight.
Before starting to do any exercises, it is a good idea to have a medical check-up. Some
people do not want to exercise because they think it will be too much work. However,
many people find that they feel very good when they exercise. Exercising can be an
enjoyable and fun way to maintain health and fitness.

## 236 - The History of Trial By July

In most English-speaking countries, a person who is accused of a crime has the right to
a "trial by jury." In a trial by jury, the guilt or innocence of the accused person is decided
by a group of 12 people, called jurors, who must listen to the evidence about the case.
The idea of trial by jury is over 800 years old, but there was a time when criminal cases
were decided in other ways. Today, many of these methods seem ridiculous and cruel.
Many accused people were forced to undergo a trial by ordeal. There were several
different kinds of this trial. For example, in the ordeal by fire, an accused man was forced
to carry a red-hot piece of iron in his hand. People believed that if the man were innocent
then the gods would protect him, and his hand would not be burned or blistered by the
iron.
Another form of the trial by ordeal was the ordeal by combat. If one person accused
another of a crime, they would be forced to fight each other with some weapon. People
believed that the gods would help the man who was right and allow him to win the fight.
Yet another kind of ordeal was the ordeal by water. If a woman was accused of a crime,
such as witchcraft, she might be thrown into a river with rocks attached to her. People
believed that the gods would help an innocent woman and allow her to float on the water.
Gradually, people realized that the trial by ordeal was a completely worthless way to
judge a person's innocence or guilt. They wanted a less barbaric way to decide criminal
cases. During the twelfth century, a new method was introduced by one of the kings of
England, Henry the Second. Henry said that criminal cases should be decided by the
opinions of twelve honest men who knew about the crime, the victim, and the accused
person. This was the beginning of trial by jury in English-speaking countries, and the
method soon became very popular. People trusted this new method much more than
they trusted the old methods.
Later, the system of trial by jury changed somewhat. Instead of having a jury of twelve
men and women who knew about the crime, juries were chosen so that the twelve people
did not know anything about the crime. This change ensures that the jurors do not have
any bias or prejudice about the case. When jurors do not know any of the people
involved in the case, their decisions are more likely to be fair and accurate.
Today, citizens in many countries are called occasionally for jury duty. This can be
inconvenient for people who are busy with their work and family life. However, many men
and women are willing to serve on juries because of a feeling of responsibility to society.
The use of juries in criminal cases helps to ensure that justice is done.

## 237 - Benjamin Franklin

Benjamin Franklin was one of the most famous people in American history. He was never
a President of the United States, but he made great achievements in many areas of life,
including business, literature, science, and politics.
Benjamin Franklin was born in the city of Boston, during the year 1706. In his early years,
Franklin was very poor. As a young man, he worked for his older brother, who was a
printer. However, the two brothers soon argued with each other. Benjamin decided to
leave, and he moved to the city of Philadelphia. He worked very hard and soon became a
successful printer. He published his own newspapers, and he also published books
called almanacs, which contained many wise sayings. Many of the wise sayings in
Franklin's almanacs are still repeated today.
Franklin's printing business was very successful, but he was also very interested in
science. He performed experiments on the topic of electricity. Some of these experiments
were very dangerous. In one experiment, Franklin was almost killed when he went
outside during a lightning storm and flew a kite that had a metal key attached. However,
Franklin was lucky enough to avoid injury, and he learned new facts about electricity.
In addition to scientific research, Franklin was also an inventor. He invented a new kind
of eye-glasses called "bifocals." Bifocals are eye-glasses that allow people to see things
that are far away, but also allow them to read things that are very close. Another
invention was a new kind of stove for burning wood. This new stove was much more
efficient than the older stoves had been. He also invented a lightning rod, which keeps
houses safe from lightning.
Franklin was also interested in making his city a better place to live. He started a public
library, and he helped to organize a hospital and a fire department. In addition, he
supervised the postal service, which operated profitably under his command. In his later
years, Franklin became heavily involved in politics. For most of Franklin's life, the United
States was not yet a country. Instead, the states were still colonies of England, but
Franklin encouraged other Americans to become an independent country. When the
United States became a country, Franklin became the American ambassador to France.
The French people liked Franklin very much. Franklin later returned to the United States,
and he died in 1790.
Today, many Americans still admire the brilliant achievements of Benjamin Franklin, who
did so much to improve people's lives. The picture of Benjamin Franklin can be seen on
the American hundred-dollar bill.

## 238 - Preservation of Forests

Many thousands of years ago, much of the world's land area was covered in forests.
Since that time, people have needed to clear the forests by cutting down the trees in
order to make room for their farms and cities. Today, forests are still being cleared, and
many people are worried that too much forest area is being lost.
There are many reasons why it is important to preserve forests. One reason is that the
trees inside the forests help to remove carbon dioxide from the air and put oxygen back
into the air. This is important, because scientists believe that too much carbon dioxide in
the air might be causing the world's temperature to increase quickly. The forests might
help to reduce this problem by absorbing carbon dioxide from the air.
Another reason for preserving forests is to maintain many different species of plants and
animals. The forests are the home of a huge variety of plants and animals, which will
become extinct if the forests are destroyed. These plants and animals are both beautiful
and interesting, but they also have practical benefits for people. For example, doctors
believe that many diseases might be treated by chemicals that are obtained from forest
plants.
Forests are also important for providing wood, or lumber, but sometimes people cut
down too many trees for lumber. To preserve the forests, it is important to ensure that the
amount of wood removed is not more than the amount of new wood that grows in the
forest. Otherwise, the forest will gradually disappear.
In many parts of the world, forests have already been cleared. In recent years, many
forests have been cleared in South America, Africa, and southeast Asia. In other parts of
the world, the forests had already been cleared a long time ago. There are only a few
areas of the world where very large areas of forests have not yet been changed by people.
These areas include the Amazon rain forest of Brazil, and the northern forests of Canada,
Alaska, and Siberia.
Some countries have passed laws to protect their forests from being cleared. For
example, a country can declare its forest areas to be a national park and prevent the
forests from being cut down. However, this is very difficult for poor countries to do. The
people may want to cut down the forests to obtain wood, to gain access to natural
resources in the forest areas, or to have new land for farming. When forests are cut down
to gain new farmland, however, people usually find that the soil is not very good for
farming.
It is a difficult challenge to provide opportunities for poor people of these countries, and
to protect the forests at the same time. However, it is very important that this challenge
be met successfully because the forests will be needed by future generations of people.

## 239
Violence on Television
Nowadays, the issue of violence on television is often debated. Many people are
concerned that the images of violent acts might cause the viewers to become more
aggressive. Some of these people believe that there should be restrictions on violent
television programs. Other people feel that individuals should be able to choose what
they want to watch on TV. Many of these people believe that violent television is unlikely
to affect people's behaviour.
One of the concerns that some people have about violent TV is that viewers might imitate
aggressive acts. For example, consider a TV program that shows professional wrestlers.
Some people believe that children who watch the program might copy the actions of the
wrestlers and that this could lead to serious injuries. As another example, consider a TV
program that shows people shooting guns at each other. Some people believe that
viewers of such a program might be more likely to use a gun in their disputes with others.
Another concern that some people have with violent TV is that it might make people less
sensitive to the effects of violence. In other words, people who watch many acts of
violence on television might no longer be shocked by violent acts. They might then
become quite tolerant of the use of violence.
Some people do not believe that violence on television is likely to have harmful effects.
They point out that many terrible acts of violence occurred long before television. They
also argue that people can tell the difference between television and real life. That is,
they say that people are unlikely to imitate violent acts, and are unlikely to become less
sensitive to violence in real life. Also, they argue that parents are able to prevent their
children from watching violent television.
Psychologists have conducted some research studies on the effects of violent television.
Some studies have shown that children who watch a lot of violent TV do become slightly
more aggressive as adults. Other studies have found that people behave somewhat more
aggressively after watching a violent program. This is especially true for people who
have an aggressive personality. Finally, some other research has found that rates of
murder tend to increase slightly in the days following a televised boxing match. Nearly all
psychologists now agree that violence on television does contribute to aggressive
behaviour in everyday life.
The issue of violence on television is difficult because it is a conflict between public
safety and individual freedom. Some people feel that violent TV should be restricted
because it might have harmful effects on society, but other people feel that individuals
should be free to watch the programs that they like.

## 240 - The Inuit

Not many people would want to live in the Arctic areas of northern Canada, Alaska, and
Greenland. In these places, the summers are very short, and the winters are extremely
cold and dark. However, there are some people who have made this land their home for
many generations. These people are called the Inuit. The word "Inuit" means "person" in
the language of the Inuit, which is called Inuktitut.
Before modern times, the Inuit had to survive by hunting. Because their homeland was in
such a cold, northern place, the Inuit could not make a living by farming or by gathering
plants. Many of the animals that the Inuit hunted are mammals that live in the water. For
example, the Inuit used boats to hunt whales. Also, they hunted seals by waiting for the
seals to rise to the surface of the water. Sometimes, the Inuit would hunt land mammals,
such as polar bears.
When eating the meat of the animals they had hunted, the Inuit often ate the meat raw.
This was necessary because only raw meat could provide them with enough nutrients to
survive in a place where fruits and vegetables were not available. In previous times, the
Inuit were known as the "Eskimos," which means "people who eat raw meat." However,
the Inuit did not like this name.
The Inuit invented many useful tools for surviving in the cold, northern areas. They
sewed warm clothing from the furs and skins of the animals they hunted. For
transportation, they used dogs, which could pull them in sleds across the snow. For
making heat and light, they used lamps that burned the fat and oil of whales.
The Inuit were famous for their houses made of snow, which were called igloos. The
igloos were made by cutting blocks of snow and then using these blocks to build a small
round-shaped house. People could enter or exit the igloo through a narrow tunnel.
In recent decades, the Inuit have had much contact with the modern world. Inuit children
now attend schools, and Inuit adults work at a variety of occupations. In some ways, the
Inuit have found it difficult to adjust to the changes from their traditional ways, but the
Inuit are meeting this challenge. In Canada, there is a new territory in the far north, called
Nunavut, where most of the people, including the leaders, are Inuit.
The Inuit are famous for their beautiful artwork. In particular, Inuit carvings or sculptures
are known for their excellent quality. These carvings, which nowadays are made from a
kind of stone called soapstone, depict people or animals such as bears, seals, or whales.
In addition to paintings, Inuit artists have produced beautiful sketches and paintings of
northern scenes.
